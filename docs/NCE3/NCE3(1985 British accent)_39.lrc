[00:16.666] Bruce was not in the least perturbed. | 布鲁斯却一点也不感到不安。
[00:19.416] Glancing at his map, he informed us that the next village was a mere 20 miles away. | 他瞥了一眼地图，告诉我们下一个村庄只有区区20英里远。

[01:19.646] In response to renewed pleadings, Bruce stopped. | 面对我们再次的恳求，布鲁斯停了下来。
[01:23.676] Though we all got out to examine the fissure, he remained in the car. | 尽管我们都下车检查裂缝，他却仍然留在车里。
[01:27.856] We informed him that the fissure extended for 50 yards, and was 2 feet wide and 4 feet deep. | 我们告诉他这条裂缝绵延50码，宽2英尺，深4英尺。
