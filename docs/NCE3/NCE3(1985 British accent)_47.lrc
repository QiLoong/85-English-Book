[00:00.000] Passage 47. | 第47篇课文。
[00:01.040] Through the Earth's crust. | 穿透地壳。
[00:06.170] Satellites orbiting round the earth have provided scientists with a vast amount of information about conditions in outer space. | 环绕地球运行的卫星已向科学家提供了大量有关外层空间情况的资料。
[00:14.490] By comparison, relatively little is known about the internal structure of the earth. | 相比之下，人们对地球内部结构知之甚少。
[00:20.200] It has proved easier to go up than to go down. | 事实证明，向上比向下容易。
[00:24.660] The deepest hole ever to be bored on land went down 25,340 feet. | 陆地上钻探的最深钻孔达到25,340英尺深。
[00:31.370] Considerably less than the height of Mount Everest. | 这比珠穆朗玛峰的高度要低得多。
[00:35.100] Drilling a hole under the sea has proved to be even more difficult. | 在海底钻孔则更为困难。
[00:39.530] The deepest hole bored under sea has been about 20,000 feet. | 海底钻探的最深钻孔大约是20,000英尺。
[00:43.750] Until recently, scientists have been unable to devise a drill which would be capable of cutting through hard rock at great depths. | 直到最近，科学家们仍未能设计出一种能够在大深度下切割坚硬岩石的钻头。
[00:52.130] This problem has now been solved. | 现在这个问题已经解决了。
[00:55.200] Scientists have developed a method which sounds surprisingly simple. | 科学家们已经开发出一种听起来出奇简单的技术。
[00:59.860] A new drill, which is being tested at Leona Valley Ranch in Texas, is driven by a turbine engine, which is propelled by liquid mud pumped into it from the surface. | 一种在德克萨斯州莱昂纳河谷牧场进行测试的新型钻头，由涡轮发动机驱动，涡轮发动机则由从地表泵入的泥浆推动。
[01:10.650] As the diamond tip of the drill revolves, it is lubricated by mud. | 随着钻头上的金刚石尖端旋转，它会得到泥浆的润滑。
[01:16.110] Scientists have been amazed to find that it can cut through the hardest rock with great ease. | 科学家们惊奇地发现，它能轻而易举地穿透最坚硬的岩石。
[01:21.620] The drill has been designed to bore through the earth to a depth of 35,000 feet. | 该钻头已被设计成能钻入地球35,000英尺深。
[01:27.310] It will enable scientists to obtain samples of the mysterious layer which lies immediately below the earth's crust. | 它将使科学家们能够获取位于地壳正下方那个神秘地层的样本。
[01:35.600] This layer is known as the Mohorovičić discontinuity. | 这个地层被称为莫霍洛维奇不连续面。
[01:39.150] But is commonly referred to as the Moho. | 但通常简称为莫霍面。
[01:42.550] Before it is possible to drill this deep hole, scientists will have to overcome a number of problems. | 在钻这个深孔之前，科学家们将不得不克服一些问题。
[01:49.380] Geological tests will be carried out to find the point at which the earth's crust is thinnest. | 将进行地质测试，以找出地壳最薄的点。
[01:55.100] The three possible sites which are being considered are all at sea. | 正在考虑的三个可能地点都在海上。
[01:59.580] Two in the Atlantic Ocean and one in the Pacific. | 大西洋有两个，太平洋有一个。
[02:03.130] Once they have determined on a site, they will have to erect a drilling vessel which will not be swept away by ocean currents. | 一旦确定了地点，他们就必须建造一艘钻探船，它不会被洋流冲走。
[02:10.770] The vessel will consist of an immense platform which will rise to 70 feet above the water. | 这艘船将由一个巨大的平台组成，它将高出水面70英尺。
[02:17.100] It will be supported by six hollow columns, which will descend to a depth of 60 feet below the ocean surface, where they will be fixed to a huge float. | 它将由六根空心柱支撑，这些柱子将下降到海面以下60英尺的深度，在那里它们将被固定在一个巨大的浮筒上。
[02:27.720] A tall steel tower, rising to a height of nearly 200 feet will rest on the platform. | 一个高大的钢塔，高近200英尺，将矗立在平台上。
[02:34.250] The drill will be stored in the tower and will have to be lowered through about 15,000 feet of water before operations can begin. | 钻头将储存在塔内，在作业开始前必须通过约15,000英尺深的水面下放。
[02:42.740] Within the tower, there will be a laboratory, living accommodation and a helicopter landing station. | 塔内将设有实验室、生活区和一个直升机停机坪。
[02:50.200] Keeping the platform in position at sea will give rise to further problems. | 保持平台在海上的位置将带来更多问题。
[02:54.830] To do this, scientists will have to devise methods using radar and underwater television. | 为此，科学家们将不得不设计使用雷达和水下电视的方法。
[03:02.190] If, during the operations, the drill has to be withdrawn, it must be possible to reinsert it. | 如果在作业期间钻头需要被抽出，必须能够重新插入。
[03:08.790] Great care will therefore have to be taken to keep the platform steady and make it strong enough to withstand hurricanes. | 因此，必须非常小心地保持平台稳定，并使其足够坚固以抵御飓风。
[03:16.530] If the project is successful, scientists will not only learn a great deal about the earth, but possibly about the nature of the universe itself. | 如果该项目成功，科学家们不仅将对地球有深入了解，还可能对宇宙本身的性质有所认识。
