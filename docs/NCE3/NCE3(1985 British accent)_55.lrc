[00:00.675] Passage 55. | 第55段。
[00:02.505] From the earth, greetings. | 来自地球的问候。
[00:06.335] Radio astronomy has greatly increased our understanding of the universe. | 射电天文学极大地增进了我们对宇宙的理解。
[00:10.875] Radio telescopes have one big advantage over conventional telescopes, | 射电望远镜比传统望远镜有一个巨大的优势，
[00:15.355] in that they can operate in all weather conditions and can pick up signals coming from very distant stars. | 那就是它们可以在所有天气条件下运行，并能接收来自非常遥远恒星的信号。
[00:22.065] These signals are produced by colliding stars or nuclear reactions in outer space. | 这些信号是由恒星碰撞或外太空中的核反应产生的。
[02:27.695] The most powerful signals that have been received have been emitted by what seem to be truly colossal stars, | 已接收到的最强大信号似乎是由真正巨大的恒星发出的，
[00:33.725] which scientists have named quasars. | 科学家将其命名为类星体。
[00:37.005] A better understanding of these phenomena may completely alter our conception of the nature of the universe. | 更好地理解这些现象可能会彻底改变我们对宇宙本质的看法。
[00:43.205] The radio telescope at Jodrell Bank in England was for many years the largest in the world. | 位于英格兰卓瑞尔河岸的射电望远镜多年来一直是世界上最大的。
[00:48.885] A new telescope over twice the size was recently built at Sugar Grove in West Virginia. | 最近，在西弗吉尼亚州的Sugar Grove建造了一台尺寸是其两倍多的新望远镜。
[00:55.355] Astronomers no longer regard as fanciful the idea that they may one day pick up signals | 天文学家不再认为有一天他们能接收到信号的想法是异想天开，
[01:00.865] which have been sent by intelligent beings on other worlds. | 这些信号是由其他星球上的智慧生命发送的。
[01:04.285] This possibility gives rise to interesting speculations. | 这种可能性引起了有趣的推测。
[01:07.825] Highly advanced civilizations may have existed on other planets long before intelligent forms of life evolved on the earth. | 高度发达的文明可能在地球上出现智慧生命之前很久就已存在于其他行星上。
[01:15.225] Conversely, intelligent beings which are just beginning to develop on remote worlds | 反之，在遥远星球上刚刚开始发展的智慧生命，
[01:19.985] may be ready to pick up our signals in thousands of years time, | 可能在数千年后准备好接收我们的信号，
[01:24.315] or when life on Earth has become extinct. | 或者当地球上的生命已经灭绝时。
[01:28.185] Such speculations no longer belong to the realm of science fiction. | 这种推测不再属于科幻小说的范畴。
[01:31.955] For astronomers are now exploring the chances of communicating with living creatures, if they exist, on distant planets. | 因为天文学家现在正在探索与遥远行星上的生物（如果它们存在）进行交流的可能性。
[01:39.125] This undertaking, which has been named Project Ozma, was begun in 1960. | 这项名为“奥兹玛计划”的工作始于1960年。
[01:44.205] But it may take a great many years before results are obtained. | 但可能需要很多年才能取得成果。
[01:48.455] Aware of the fact that it would be impossible to wait thousands or millions of years | 意识到等待数千年或数百万年
[01:52.925] to receive an answer from a distant planet, | 以接收来自遥远行星的回复是不可能的，
[01:55.515] scientists engaged in Project Ozma are concentrating their attention on stars which are relatively close. | 参与奥兹玛计划的科学家们正将注意力集中在相对较近的恒星上。
[02:02.575] One of the most likely stars is Tau Ceti, which is 11 light-years away. | 最有可能的恒星之一是鲸鱼座τ星，它距离地球11光年。
[02:07.975] If signals from the Earth were received by intelligent creatures on a planet circling this star, | 如果来自地球的信号被围绕这颗恒星运行的行星上的智慧生命接收到，
[02:14.075] we would have to wait 22 years for an answer. | 我们将不得不等待22年才能得到答复。
[02:17.655] The Green Bank telescope in West Virginia has been specially designed to distinguish between random signals and signals which might be in code. | 西弗吉尼亚州的绿岸望远镜经过专门设计，能够区分随机信号和可能编码的信号。
[02:26.585] Even if contact were eventually established, | 即使最终建立了联系，
[02:29.495] astronomers would not be able to rely on language to communicate with other beings. | 天文学家也无法依靠语言与其他生物交流。
[02:33.885] They would use mathematics, as this is the only truly universal language. | 他们会使用数学，因为这是唯一真正的通用语言。
[02:38.745] Numbers have the same value anywhere. | 数字在任何地方都具有相同的价值。
[02:41.775] For this reason, intelligent creatures in any part of the universe | 因此，宇宙中任何地方的智慧生物
[02:45.385] would be able to understand a simple arithmetical sequence. | 都能够理解一个简单的算术序列。
[02:50.085] They would be able to reply to our signals using similar methods. | 他们将能够使用类似的方法回复我们的信号。
[02:54.895] The next step would be to try to develop means for sending television pictures. | 下一步将是尝试开发发送电视图像的方法。
[02:59.695] A single picture would tell us more than thousands of words. | 一张图片所表达的内容将胜过千言万语。
[03:04.295] In an age when anything seems to be possible, | 在一个似乎一切皆有可能的时代，
