[00:05.804]Cave exploration, or pot holing as it has come to be known, | 洞穴探险，或者说洞穴探勘，正如它现在所为人知的那样，

[01:23.64]The entrance to the cave is on a plateau in the Dauphiné Alps. | 洞穴的入口位于多芬阿尔卑斯山脉的一个高原上。
[01:27.914]As it is only 6 feet across, it is barely noticeable. | 由于它只有6英尺宽，所以几乎难以察觉。
[01:32.444]The cave might never have been discovered had not the entrance been spotted by the distinguished French pot holler Berger. | 如果不是著名的法国洞穴探险家贝尔热发现了入口，这个洞穴可能永远不会被发现。

[02:01.814]They had to edge their way along this, sometimes wading across shallow streams or swimming across deep pools. | 他们不得不沿着这条路小心翼翼地前进，有时涉过浅溪，有时游过深潭。
[02:09.684]Suddenly they came to a waterfall which dropped into an underground lake at the bottom of the cave. | 突然，他们来到了一处瀑布，瀑布落入洞穴底部的一个地下湖泊。
[02:15.224]They plunged into the lake and after loading their gear on an inflatable rubber dingy, let the current carry them to the other side. | 他们跳入湖中，将装备装载到充气橡皮艇上后，任由水流将他们带到对岸。

[02:29.624]At the far end of the lake, they came to huge piles of rubble which had been washed up by the water. | 在湖的尽头，他们看到大量被水冲上来的碎石堆。
[02:35.844]In this part of the cave, they could hear an insistent booming sound which they found was caused by a small water spout shooting down into a pool from the roof of the cave. | 在洞穴的这部分，他们能听到一种持续不断的轰鸣声，他们发现这是由一个从小水管从洞穴顶部射入水池造成的。
