[00:00.000]Passage 43. | 第43段。
[00:02.910]Faith in controlled nuclear fission is now being shown by the construction of atomic power stations. | 对受控核裂变的信心，如今正通过原子能发电站的建设得以体现。
[00:09.300]In Britain, Calder Hall, on the coast of Cumberland, first made its contribution to the national electricity grid in 1957. | 在英国，位于坎伯兰海岸的卡尔德霍尔，于1957年首次为国家电网做出贡献。
[00:17.390]Subsequently, a chain of nuclear power stations was planned. | 随后，规划了一系列核电站。
[00:21.840]Of necessity, they are sited near the coasts or tidal water, | 出于必要，它们被设置在海岸或潮汐水域附近，
[00:25.440]because of the need of much water for cooling and a certain discharge of possible radioactive effluent. | 因为需要大量水进行冷却，并且要排放一定量的可能放射性废水。
[00:32.370]Atomic power is associated in the public mind with the destructive force of atom bombs, | 原子能在大众心中与原子弹的破坏力联系在一起，
[00:38.210]and partly for this reason, | 部分原因在于此，
[00:39.690]though it is claimed that there is no danger to be associated with atomic power stations, | 尽管声称原子能发电站没有相关危险，
[00:44.200]they are being sited away from populous centers. | 但它们被设置在远离人口稠密中心的地方。
[00:47.880]The present position is that the three main sources of power are coal, oil, and water power. | 目前的情况是，主要的三种能源是煤炭、石油和水力。
[00:54.910]We sometimes refer to electricity, gas or petrol as if they were the actual sources of power, | 我们有时会将电力、天然气或汽油称为实际的能源，
[01:01.520]forgetting that electricity must be generated by the consumption of coal or oil, or by the utilization of water power, | 忘记了电力必须通过消耗煤炭或石油，或利用水力来产生，
[01:09.000]whilst coke, gas and petrol are examples of secondary fuels by which coal and oil may be more effectively used. | 而焦炭、天然气和汽油是二次燃料的例子，通过它们，煤炭和石油可以更有效地利用。
[01:17.930]Where alternative sources of power are available, there are some marked contrasts in handling. | 在有替代能源的地方，处理方式上存在一些显著差异。
[01:23.470]The bulk and weights of coal required in the majority of manufacturing industries is large in comparison with the bulk and the weight of other raw materials. | 大多数制造业所需的煤炭体积和重量与其它原材料的体积和重量相比要大得多。
[01:33.000]This is not always true, as with the manufacture of pig iron and steel from low-grade iron ores, | 这并非总是如此，例如从低品位铁矿石生产生铁和钢铁，
[01:39.380]but it did lead to the concentration of industrial developments on the coal fields, | 但它确实导致了工业发展集中在煤田上，
[01:44.300]a phenomenon well seen in such countries as Britain, where the industrial revolution came before the days of oil or electricity. | 这一现象在英国等国家表现得很明显，那里工业革命发生在石油或电力时代之前。
[01:53.480]Coal, being a solid, must be distributed mainly by rail or water. | 煤炭作为固体，主要通过铁路或水路运输。
[01:58.740]By way of contrast, oil can be transported large distances by pipeline, | 相比之下，石油可以通过管道长距离运输，
[02:03.740]but overseas movement has involved building of a large numbers of tankers, including now some of the largest vessels afloat. | 但海外运输涉及建造大量油轮，现在甚至包括一些最大的在航船只。
[02:12.790]Unless suitable on other grounds, oil fields have not become industrial regions. | 除非在其他方面合适，否则油田并未成为工业区。
[02:17.840]On the contrary, the oil industry is marked by a certain amount of smell and an element of danger, | 相反，石油工业的特点是存在一定气味和危险因素，
[02:23.180]hence the siting of refineries at a distance from population centers. | 因此，炼油厂通常设在远离人口中心的地方。
[02:28.140]It is not always realized that the owners of pipelines can handle the oil of different customers, | 人们并非总是意识到管道所有者可以处理不同客户的石油，
[02:33.360]sending it through at different periods. | 在不同时期输送。
[02:36.140]Natural gas can also be transported large distances by pipe. | 天然气也可以通过管道长距离运输。
[02:40.850]Early in 1959, Britain received the first ship cargo of natural gas, | 1959年初，英国接收了第一批船运天然气，
[02:46.060]liquefied for the purpose of transport. | 为运输目的而液化。
