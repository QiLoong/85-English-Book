[00:00.000] Passage 37 | 第37篇短文
[00:02.828] The Victorians, realizing that the greatest happiness accorded to man, is that provided by a happy marriage, endeavoured to pretend that all their marriages were happy. | 维多利亚时代的人们意识到，人类最大的幸福莫过于拥有一桩幸福的婚姻，因此他们竭力假装自己的所有婚姻都是幸福的。
[00:14.288] We for our part, admitting the fact that no feat of intelligence and character is so exacting as that required of two people who desire to live permanently together on a basis of amity, | 而我们，则承认这样一个事实：没有任何一项智力和性格上的壮举，比两个人希望在友好的基础上永久地生活在一起所要求的更为严苛，

[00:37.748] The Victorians would have considered it painful or unpleasant, were one to point out that only four marriages out of every ten are anything but forced servitudes. | 如果有人指出每十桩婚姻中只有四桩不是被迫的奴役，维多利亚时代的人们会觉得这既痛苦又令人不快。

[01:14.418] But it's more important not to think lies or to slide into those mechanical and untruthful habits of thought, which are so pleasant and so easy as to sense to mental ineptitude. | 但更重要的是不要谎想，不要陷入那些机械化且不真实的思维习惯，它们如此令人愉悦和轻松，以至于让人陷入心智上的迟钝。
[01:26.548] The Victorian habit of mind, which I consider to have been a bad habit of mind, were unduly preoccupied by what was socially and morally convenient. | 维多利亚时代的心智习惯——我认为那是一种糟糕的心智习惯——过分专注于社会和道德上便利的事物。
[01:36.768] Convenience is however, in all affairs of life, an execrable test of value. | 然而，便利在生活中的所有事务中，都是一个糟糕的价值衡量标准。
[01:41.908] One should have the courage to think uncomfortably, since it is only by rejecting the convenience that one can come to think the truth. | 一个人应该有勇气去思考令人不舒服的事情，因为只有拒绝便利，才能思考出真相。

[02:21.828] One's awareness in the former case is in general more acute than in the latter, since we are more on the lookout for the lies we utter than for those we merely think. | 在前一种情况下，一个人的意识通常比后一种情况更敏锐，因为我们更警惕自己说出的谎言，而不是仅仅在心里想的谎言。
[02:32.258] In fact, however, it is the untruthful thought which is the more vicious of the two. | 然而，事实上，不诚实的思想在两者中更为恶劣。
[02:37.928] Spoken lies are invariably tiresome and may actually be dishonest. | 说出来的谎言总是令人厌烦，而且实际上可能是不诚实的。
[02:42.848] But continuous lying in the mind, a disease to which the Anglo-Saxon is peculiarly exposed, spells the destruction of human thought and character. | 然而，持续的心思谎言——一种盎格鲁-撒克逊人特别容易患上的疾病——预示着人类思想和品格的毁灭。
