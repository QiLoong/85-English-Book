[00:00.000] Passage 44. | 第44篇文章。
[00:02.830] If a nation is essentially disunited, | 如果一个国家本质上是分裂的，
[00:05.510] it is left to the government to hold it together. | 那么只能由政府将其凝聚在一起。
[00:08.680] This increases the expense of government | 这会增加政府的开支，
[00:11.450] and reduces correspondingly the amount of economic resources | 并相应减少可用于发展国家
[00:14.650] that could be used for developing the country. | 的经济资源。
[00:18.40] And it should not be forgotten how small those resources are | 而且不应忘记，在一个贫穷落后的国家里，
[00:21.840] in a poor and backward country. | 那些资源是多么的稀少。
[00:24.490] Where the cost of government is high, | 在政府开支高昂的地方，
[00:26.790] resources for development are correspondingly low. | 发展资源也相应地稀少。
[00:30.950] This may be illustrated by comparing the position of a nation | 这可以通过比较一个国家
[00:34.200] with that of a private business enterprise. | 与一个私人企业的情况来说明。
[00:38.290] An enterprise has to incur certain costs and expenses | 一个企业为了维持经营，
[00:41.870] in order to stay in business. | 必须承担一定的成本和开支。
[00:44.750] For our purposes, | 就我们的目的而言，
[00:46.100] we are concerned only with one kind of cost, | 我们只关注一种成本：
[00:48.330] the cost of managing and administering the business. | 经营和管理企业的成本。
[00:53.330] Such administrative overhead in a business | 企业中的此类管理开销
[00:55.700] is analogous to the cost of government in a nation. | 类似于一个国家的政府开支。
[00:59.390] The administrative overhead of a business is low to the extent | 企业的管理开销之所以低，是因为
[01:03.200] that everyone working in the business can be trusted to behave in a way | 企业中的每个人都可以被信任，以一种最能促进公司利益的方式行事，
[01:07.960] that best promotes the interest of the firm. | 从而最大化公司的利益。
[01:10.590] If they can each be trusted to take such responsibilities | 如果每个人都能被信任承担起这些责任，
[01:14.180] and to exercise such initiative as falls within their sphere, | 并在其职责范围内发挥主动性，
[01:17.910] then administrative overhead will be low. | 那么管理开销就会很低。
[01:21.570] It will be low because it will be necessary to have only one man | 之所以低，是因为只需要一个人
[01:24.810] looking after each job, | 负责每项工作，
[01:26.250] without having another man to check upon what he is doing, | 而不需要另一个人来检查他正在做什么，
[01:29.470] keep him in line, | 让他遵守规定，
[01:30.790] and report on him to someone else. | 并向其他人汇报他的情况。
[01:34.300] But if no one can be trusted to act in a loyal and responsible manner | 但是，如果没有人能够被信任以忠诚和负责任的方式履行其工作职责，
[01:38.640] towards his job, | 那么，
[01:39.460] then the business will require armies of administrators, | 企业就需要大量的管理者、
[01:42.340] checkers, and foremen, | 检查员和工头，
[01:44.380] and administrative overhead will rise correspondingly. | 管理开销也将相应增加。
[01:48.740] As administrative overhead rises, | 随着管理开销的增加，
[01:50.560] so the earnings of the business, | 企业的收益，
[01:52.920] after meeting the expense of administration, will fall, | 在支付了管理费用之后，将会下降，
[01:56.240] and the business will have less money to distribute as dividends | 企业将有更少的资金用于分配股息，
[01:59.620] or invest directly in its future progress and development. | 或直接投资于未来的发展。
[02:04.480] It is precisely the same with a nation. | 一个国家的情况也正是如此。
[02:07.450] To the extent that the people can be relied upon to behave | 只要人民能够被信任以忠诚和负责任的方式行事，
[02:11.750] in a loyal and responsible manner, | 那么，
[02:12.190] the government does not require armies of police | 政府就不需要大量的警察和公务员
[02:15.540] and civil servants to keep them in order. | 来维持秩序。
[02:17.650] But if a nation is disunited, | 但如果一个国家是分裂的，
[02:19.460] the government cannot be sure that the actions of the people | 政府就无法确定人民的行为是否符合国家利益。
[02:23.950] will be in the interests of the nation. |
[02:25.220] And it will have to watch, check, and control the people accordingly. | 因此，政府将不得不相应地监督、检查和控制人民。
[02:30.130] A disunited nation, therefore, | 因此，一个分裂的国家，
[02:32.420] has to incur unduly high costs of government. | 必须承担过高的政府开支。
