[00:01.890] Passage 36 | 文章 36
[00:04.140] Our knowledge of the oceans 100 years ago was confined to the two-dimensional shape of the sea surface and the hazards of navigation presented by the irregularities in depth of the shallow water close to the land. | 100年前，我们对海洋的认识仅限于海面的二维形状，以及陆地附近浅水区深度不规则所带来的航行危险。
[00:18.960] The open sea was deep and mysterious, and anyone who gave more than a passing thought to the bottom confines of the oceans, probably assumed that the seabed was flat. | 公海深邃而神秘，任何对海底边界稍作思考的人，可能都认为海底是平坦的。
[00:29.610] Sir James Clark Ross had obtained a sounding of over 2,400 fathoms in 1839. | 詹姆斯·克拉克·罗斯爵士在1839年测得超过2400噚的深度。
[00:37.520] But it was not until 1869, when HMS Porcupine was put at the disposal of the Royal Society for several cruises, that a series of deep soundings was obtained in the Atlantic, and the first samples were collected by dredging the bottom. | 但直到1869年，“豪猪”号军舰被皇家学会征用进行数次航行，才在大西洋进行了系列深海探测，并通过拖网采集了第一批样本。
[00:54.670] Shortly after this, the famous HMS Challenger expedition established the study of the sea floor as a subject worthy of the most qualified physicists and geologists. | 此后不久，著名的“挑战者”号军舰探险确立了海底研究作为一门值得最合格的物理学家和地质学家研究的学科。
[01:07.130] A burst of activity associated with the laying of submarine cables soon confirmed the Challenger's observation that many parts of the ocean were two to three miles deep, and the existence of underwater features of considerable magnitude. | 随后，与铺设海底电缆相关的活动激增，很快证实了“挑战者”号的观测结果，即海洋的许多部分有两到三英里深，并且存在相当规模的海底地貌。
[01:24.460] Today, enough soundings are available to enable a relief map of the Atlantic to be drawn, and we know something of the great variety of the seabed's topography. | 如今，已有的探测数据足以绘制大西洋的地形图，我们对海底地形的巨大多样性也有所了解。
[01:36.210] Since the sea covers the greater part of the Earth's surface, it is quite reasonable to regard the sea floor as the basic form of the crust of the Earth, with super-imposed upon it the continents, together with the islands and other features of the oceans. | 由于海洋覆盖了地球表面的大部分，因此将海底视为地壳的基本形态，其上叠加有大陆、岛屿和海洋的其他特征，这是相当合理的。
[01:53.030] The continents form rugged tablelands which stand nearly three miles above the floor of the open ocean. | 大陆形成崎岖的高原，比开阔大洋的海底高出近三英里。
[02:01.210] From the shoreline out to a distance which may be anywhere from a few miles to a few hundred miles, runs the gentle slope of the continental shelf, geologically part of the continents. | 从海岸线向外延伸，距离可从几英里到几百英里不等，是大陆架的平缓坡度，从地质学上讲，它属于大陆的一部分。
[02:12.920] The real dividing line between continents and oceans occurs at the foot of a steeper slope. | 大陆与海洋的真正分界线出现在一个更陡峭的斜坡底部。
[02:19.460] This continental slope usually starts at a place somewhere near the 100-fathom mark, and in the course of a few hundred miles reaches the true ocean floor at 2,500 to 3,000 fathoms. | 这个大陆坡通常始于100噚线附近，在几百英里的范围内，深度达到2500到3000噚，到达真正的洋底。
[02:33.790] The slope averages about 1 in 30, but contains steep, probably vertical cliffs and gentle sediment-covered terraces. | 该斜坡平均坡度约为1:30，但包含陡峭的、可能垂直的悬崖和被沉积物覆盖的平缓阶地。
[02:43.080] And near its lower reaches, there is a long tailing off which is almost certainly the result of material transported out to deep water after being eroded from the continental masses. | 在其下部区域附近，有一个长长的拖尾部分，这几乎可以肯定是从大陆块体侵蚀下来的物质被输运到深水区的结果。
