[00:02.265] In his own lifetime, Galileo was the center of violent controversy. | 在伽利略生前，他一直是激烈争议的中心。
[00:06.855] The scientific dust has long since settled, and today, | 科学的尘埃早已落定，如今，
[00:09.885] we can see even his famous clash with the Inquisition in something like its proper perspective. | 即使是他与宗教裁判所的著名冲突，我们也能从一个恰当的角度来看待。
[00:16.555] But in contrast, it's only in modern times that Galileo has become a problem child for historians in science. | 但相比之下，直到近代，伽利略才成为科学史学家眼中的“问题儿童”。
[00:24.605] The old view of Galileo was delightfully uncomplicated. | 过去对伽利略的看法非常简单。
[00:27.855] He was, above all, a man who experimented, who despised the prejudices and book-learning of the Aristotelians, | 他首先是一位实验者，蔑视亚里士多德学派的偏见和书本知识，
[00:36.315] who put his questions to nature instead of to the ancients, | 他向自然而不是向古人提出问题，
[00:40.195] and who drew his conclusions fearlessly. | 并无畏地得出自己的结论。
[00:43.305] He had been the first to turn a telescope to the sky, and he had seen there evidence enough to overthrow Aristotle and Ptolemy together. | 他是第一个将望远镜对准天空的人，并在那里看到了足以同时推翻亚里士多德和托勒密的证据。
[00:52.195] He was the man who climbed the leaning tower of Pisa and dropped various weights from the top, | 他曾爬上比萨斜塔，从塔顶扔下不同的重物，
[00:57.415] who rolled balls down inclined planes, and then generalized the results of his many experiments into the famous law of free fall. | 他曾让球从斜面滚下，然后将他众多实验的结果概括为著名的自由落体定律。
[01:05.495] But a closer study of the evidence, supported by a deeper sense of the period and particularly by a new consciousness of the philosophical undercurrents in the scientific revolution, has profoundly modified this view of Galileo. | 然而，对证据更深入的研究，加上对那个时代更深刻的理解，特别是对科学革命中哲学暗流的新认识，深刻地改变了对伽利略的看法。
[01:18.725] Today, although the old Galileo lives on in many popular writings, among historians of science, a new and more sophisticated picture has emerged. | 如今，尽管旧有的伽利略形象仍在许多流行著作中流传，但在科学史学家中，一个全新且更复杂的形象已经浮现。
[01:29.735] At the same time, our sympathy for Galileo's opponents has grown somewhat. | 与此同时，我们对伽利略的反对者的同情也有所增加。
[01:34.835] His telescopic observations are justly immortal. | 他的望远镜观测理应永垂不朽。
[01:38.225] They aroused great interest at the time, they had important theoretical consequences, and they provided a striking demonstration of the potentialities hidden in instruments and apparatus. | 它们在当时引起了巨大兴趣，具有重要的理论意义，并有力地展示了仪器和设备中蕴藏的潜力。
[01:49.505] But can we blame those who looked and failed to see what Galileo saw? | 但是，我们能责怪那些观察了却未能看到伽利略所见之人吗？
[01:54.305] if we remember that to use a telescope at the limit of its powers calls for long experience and intimate familiarity with one's instrument. | 如果我们记住，要在望远镜的极限性能下使用它，需要长期的经验以及对仪器的深入了解。
[02:03.685] Was the philosopher who refused to look through Galileo's telescope more culpable than those who alleged that the spiral nebulae observed with Lord Rosse's great telescope in the 1840s were scratches left by the grinder? | 拒绝透过伽利略望远镜观察的哲学家，是否比那些声称19世纪40年代用罗斯勋爵的巨型望远镜观测到的螺旋星云是研磨师留下的划痕的人，更应受责备？
[02:17.405] We can perhaps forgive those who said that the moons of Jupiter were produced by Galileo's spyglass, | 也许我们可以原谅那些说木星的卫星是伽利略的望远镜产生的说法，
[02:22.785] if we recall that in his day, as for centuries before, curved glass was the popular contrivance for producing not truth but illusion, untruth. | 如果我们回想起，在他的时代，以及之前的几个世纪，弯曲的玻璃是一种流行的工具，它不是用来产生真相，而是产生幻觉，即虚假。
[02:32.45] And if a single curved glass would distort nature, how much more would a pair of them? | 如果一块弯曲的玻璃会扭曲自然，那么两块又会扭曲多少呢？
