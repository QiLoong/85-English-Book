[00:00.672] Passage 2. | 第二段。
[00:02.482] Why, you may wonder, should spiders be our friends? | 为什么，你可能会想，蜘蛛应该是我们的朋友？
[00:06.632] Because they destroy so many insects, and insects include some of the greatest enemies of the human race. | 因为它们消灭了如此多的昆虫，而昆虫包括了人类最大的敌人中的一部分。
[00:14.502] Insects would make it impossible for us to live in the world. | 昆虫会让我们无法在这个世界上生存。
[00:18.422] They would devour all our crops and kill our flocks and herds. | 它们会吞噬我们所有的庄稼，杀死我们的羊群和牛群。
[00:22.582] If it were not for the protection we get from insect-eating animals. | 如果没有食虫动物给我们的保护。
[00:28.012] We owe a lot to the birds and beasts who eat insects. | 我们非常感谢那些吃昆虫的鸟兽。
[00:32.492] But all of them put together kill only a fraction of the number destroyed by spiders. | 但它们加起来所杀死的昆虫数量，只是蜘蛛所消灭的一小部分。
[00:38.902] Moreover, unlike some of the other insect eaters, spiders never do the least harm to us or our belongings. | 此外，与其他一些食虫动物不同，蜘蛛从不对我们或我们的财物造成丝毫伤害。
[00:48.602] Spiders are not insects, as many people think, nor even nearly related to them. | 蜘蛛不是昆虫，正如许多人认为的那样，甚至与它们没有密切关系。
[00:54.212] One can tell the difference almost at a glance, for a spider always has eight legs, and an insect never more than six. | 人们几乎一眼就能分辨出区别，因为蜘蛛总是有八条腿，而昆虫从不超过六条。
[01:03.202] How many spiders are engaged in this work on our behalf? | 有多少蜘蛛正在为我们做这项工作？
[01:07.452] One authority on spiders made a census of the spiders in a grass field in the south of England, | 一位研究蜘蛛的权威人士对英格兰南部一片草地上的蜘蛛进行了普查，
[01:14.342] and he estimated that there were more than 2,250,000 in one acre. | 他估计，一英亩土地上就有超过2,250,000只蜘蛛。
[01:20.402] That is something like 6 million spiders of different kinds on a football pitch. | 这就像一个足球场上有600万只不同种类的蜘蛛。
[01:26.602] Spiders are busy for at least half the year in killing insects. | 蜘蛛一年中至少有一半时间忙于捕杀昆虫。
[01:31.272] It is impossible to make more than the wildest guess at how many they kill, | 要猜测它们杀死了多少，这是不可能的，只能做最粗略的估计，
[01:36.272] but they are hungry creatures, not content with only three meals a day. | 但它们是饥饿的生物，不满足于一天只吃三餐。
[01:41.512] It has been estimated that the weight of all the insects destroyed by spiders in Britain in one year | 据估计，英国一年内被蜘蛛消灭的所有昆虫的总重量
[01:47.852] would be greater than the total weight of all the human beings in the country. | 将超过该国所有人类的总重量。
