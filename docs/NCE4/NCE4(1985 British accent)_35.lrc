[00:00.672] Passage 35. | 第35篇。
[00:02.322] Many strange new means of transport have been developing in our century. | 在我们这个世纪里，许多新奇的交通工具相继问世。
[00:06.652] The strangest of them being perhaps the hovercraft. | 其中最奇特的可能要数气垫船了。
[00:10.582] In 1953, a former electronics engineer in his 50s, Christopher Cockerell, | 1953年，一位50多岁的前电子工程师克里斯托弗·科克雷尔，
[00:15.542] who had turned to boat building on the Norfolk Broads, suggested an idea on which he had been working for many years to the British government and industrial circles. | 他当时已转行在诺福克湖区造船，向英国政府和工业界提出了一个他已研究多年的想法。
[00:25.432] It was the idea of supporting a craft on a pad or cushion of low-pressure air, ringed with a cushion of high-pressure air. | 他的想法是，用一个低压气垫支撑船只，气垫周围环绕着一个高压气垫。
[00:34.402] Ever since, people have had difficulty in deciding whether the craft should be ranged among ships, planes or land vehicles, | 从那时起，人们就很难确定这种交通工具究竟应该归入船舶、飞机还是陆地车辆，
[00:41.532] or is something in between a boat and an aircraft. | 还是介于船和飞机之间的一种东西。
[00:46.212] As a shipbuilder, Cockerell was trying to find a solution to the problem of the wave resistance, | 作为一名造船师，科克雷尔试图找到解决波浪阻力问题的方法，
[00:51.352] which wastes a good deal of a surface ship's power and limits its speed. | 波浪阻力会消耗水面船只大量的动力并限制其速度。
[00:57.302] His answer was to lift the vessel out of the water by making it ride on a cushion of air no more than one or two feet thick. | 他的解决方案是，让船只浮在厚度不超过一两英尺的气垫上，从而使其离开水面。
[01:04.492] This is done by a great number of ring-shaped air jets on the bottom of the craft. | 这是通过船底大量的环形喷气口来实现的。
[01:09.612] It flies, therefore, but it cannot fly higher. | 因此，它能飞行，但不能飞得太高。
[01:13.272] Its action depends on the surface, water or ground, over which it rides. | 它的运动取决于它所行驶的水面或地面。
[01:19.232] The first tests on the Solent in 1959 caused a sensation. | 1959年在索伦特海峡进行的首次试验引起了轰动。
[01:23.362] The hovercraft traveled first over the water, then mounted the beach, climbed up the dunes and sat down on a road. | 气垫船先是在水面上航行，然后登上沙滩，爬上沙丘，最后停在路上。
[01:31.782] Later, it crossed the Channel, riding smoothly over the waves which presented no problem. | 后来，它跨越了英吉利海峡，平稳地在海浪上行驶，毫无问题。
[01:37.582] Since that time, various types of hovercraft have appeared and taken up regular service, | 从那时起，各种类型的气垫船相继出现并投入定期服务，
[01:43.022] cruises on the Thames in London, for instance, have become an annual attraction. | 例如，伦敦泰晤士河上的游船已成为一年一度的景点。
[01:47.762] But we are only at the beginning of a development that may transform sea and land transport. | 但我们只是处于一项可能彻底改变水陆交通的发展的开端。
[01:53.482] Christopher Cockerell's craft can establish transport networks in large areas with poor communications, such as Africa or Australia. | 克里斯托弗·科克雷尔的气垫船可以在通信条件差的广阔地区建立交通网络，例如非洲或澳大利亚。
[02:02.162] It can become a flying fruit-boat carrying bananas from the plantations to the ports. | 它可以成为一种飞行的水果船，将香蕉从种植园运到港口。
[02:06.902] Giant hovercraft liners could span the Atlantic. | 巨型气垫船客轮可以横跨大西洋。
[02:09.612] And the railways of the future may well be the hover train riding on its air cushion over a single rail which it never touches at speeds up to 300 miles per hour. | 而未来的铁路很可能是气垫列车，它以每小时300英里的速度，在气垫上沿单轨行驶，永不触及轨道。
[02:19.782] The possibilities appear unlimited. | 可能性似乎是无限的。
