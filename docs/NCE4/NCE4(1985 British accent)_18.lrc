[00:00.000]Passage 18. | 第18段。
[00:02.820]Two factors weigh heavily against the effectiveness of scientific research in industry. | 有两个因素严重阻碍了工业中科学研究的有效性。
[00:09.500]One is the general atmosphere of secrecy in which it is carried out; the other, the lack of freedom of the individual research worker. | 一个是研究开展过程中普遍存在的保密氛围；另一个是个人研究人员缺乏自由。
[00:19.680]In so far as any inquiry is a secret one, it naturally limits all those engaged in carrying it out from effective contact with their fellow scientists, either in other countries or in universities, or even, often enough, in other departments of the same firm. | 只要任何一项调查是秘密进行的，它自然会限制所有参与者与他们的同行科学家进行有效接触，无论是在其他国家还是在大学，甚至，通常情况下，在同一公司的其他部门。
[00:39.750]The degree of secrecy naturally varies considerably. | 保密程度自然差异很大。
[00:44.690]Some of the bigger firms are engaged in researches which are of such general and fundamental nature that it is a positive advantage to them not to keep them secret. | 一些大型公司从事的研究具有普遍性和基础性，以至于不保密对它们来说是一个积极的优势。
[00:56.120]Yet, a great many processes depending on such research are sought for with complete secrecy until the stage at which patents can be taken out. | 然而，许多依赖此类研究的工艺都完全保密地进行，直到可以申请专利的阶段。
[01:07.560]Even more processes are never patented at all, but kept as secret processes. | 更多的工艺根本不申请专利，而是作为秘密工艺保留。
[01:14.730]This applies particularly to chemical industries, where chance discoveries play a much larger part than they do in physical and mechanical industries. | 这尤其适用于化学工业，在化学工业中，偶然发现所起的作用比在物理和机械工业中要大得多。
[01:26.030]Sometimes the secrecy goes to such an extent that the whole nature of the research cannot be mentioned. | 有时保密程度如此之高，以至于研究的整个性质都无法提及。
[01:33.720]Many firms, for instance, have great difficulty in obtaining technical or scientific books from libraries because they are unwilling to have their names entered as having taken out such and such a book, for fear the agents of other firms should be able to trace the kind of research they are likely to be undertaking. | 例如，许多公司在从图书馆获取技术或科学书籍时遇到很大困难，因为他们不愿意登记姓名，以免其他公司的代理人能够追溯他们可能正在进行的研究类型。
