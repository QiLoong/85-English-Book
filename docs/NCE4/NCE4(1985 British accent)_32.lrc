[00:00.108] Passage 32. | 第32段。
[00:02.648] It is animals and plants which lived in or near water, whose remains are most likely to be preserved, for one of the necessary conditions of preservation is quick burial. | 生活在水边或水中的动物和植物的遗骸最有可能被保存下来，因为保存的必要条件之一是快速埋藏。
[00:13.388] And it is only in the seas and rivers, and sometimes lakes, where mud and silt have been continuously deposited, that bodies and the like can be rapidly covered over and preserved. | 只有在海洋、河流以及有时是湖泊中，泥沙不断沉积的地方，尸体等才能迅速被覆盖并保存下来。
[00:26.288] But even in the most favorable circumstances, only a small fraction of the creatures that die are preserved in this way before decay sets in, or, even more likely, before scavengers eat them. | 但即使在最有利的情况下，死亡的生物中也只有一小部分能以这种方式保存下来，免于腐烂，或者，更有可能的是，在被食腐动物吃掉之前。
[00:38.648] After all, all living creatures live by feeding on something else, whether it be plant or animal, dead or alive, and it is only by chance that such fate is avoided. | 毕竟，所有生物都靠捕食其他生物而生，无论是植物还是动物，死的还是活的，只有偶然才能避免这种命运。
[00:50.318] The remains of plants and animals that lived on land are much more rarely preserved, for there is seldom anything to cover them over. | 生活在陆地上的动植物遗骸很少能被保存下来，因为很少有东西能覆盖它们。
[00:59.198] When you think of the innumerable birds that one sees flying about, not to mention the equally numerous small animals like field mice and voles, which you do not see, it is very rarely that one comes across a dead body, except, of course, on the roads. | 当你想到空中飞舞的无数鸟类，更不用说那些你看不到的同样多的像野鼠和鼢鼠那样的小动物时，你很少会遇到一具尸体，当然，除了在公路上。
[01:15.478] They decompose and are quickly destroyed by the weather or eaten by some other creature. | 它们会腐烂，并很快被天气破坏或被其他生物吃掉。
[01:22.158] It is almost always due to some very special circumstances that traces of land animals survive, as by falling into inaccessible caves or into an ice crevice, like the Siberian mammoths, when the whole animal is sometimes preserved as in a refrigerator. | 陆地动物的痕迹之所以能保存下来，几乎总是由于一些非常特殊的情况，例如坠入无法进入的洞穴或冰缝中，就像西伯利亚猛犸象一样，有时整个动物都能像在冰箱里一样被保存下来。
[01:40.028] This is what happened to the famous Berezovka mammoth, which was found preserved and in good condition. | 这就是著名的别列佐夫卡猛犸象的遭遇，它被发现时保存完好。
[01:46.288] In his mouth were the remains of fir trees, the last meal that he had before he fell into the crevice and broke his back. | 它的嘴里有冷杉树的残骸，那是它在掉进裂缝摔断脊骨之前的最后一餐。
[01:54.268] The mammoth has now been restored in the paleontological museum in Leningrad. | 这只猛犸象现在已在列宁格勒的古生物学博物馆中修复。
[02:00.268] Other animals were trapped in tar pits, like the elephants, saber-toothed cats, and numerous other creatures that are found at Rancho La Brea, which is now just a suburb of Los Angeles. | 其他动物则被困在焦油坑中，比如大象、剑齿虎，以及在拉布雷亚牧场发现的许多其他生物，拉布雷亚牧场现在只是洛杉矶的一个郊区。
[02:12.488] Apparently, what happened was that water collected on these tar pits, and the bigger animals like the elephants ventured out onto the apparently firm surface to drink and were promptly bogged in the tar. | 显然，发生的情况是水聚集在这些焦油坑上，像大象这样的大型动物冒险走到看似坚实的表面喝水，然后迅速陷入焦油中。
[02:25.478] And then, when they were dead, the carnivores, like the saber-toothed cats and the giant wolves, came out to feed and suffered exactly the same fate. | 然后，当它们死亡后，像剑齿虎和巨型狼这样的食肉动物出来进食，也遭受了同样的命运。
[02:35.68] There are also endless numbers of birds in the tar as well. | 焦油中也有无数只鸟。
[02:40.248] Errol White. | 埃罗尔·怀特。
[02:41.968] The Past Life of the Earth. | 地球的过去生命。
[02:43.928] From Discovery. | 选自《发现》。
