[00:00.672] Passage 60. | 文章 60。
[00:03.012] Although truth and justice may be the most powerful impulses to show moral courage, there are others. | 尽管真理和正义可能是展现道德勇气的最强大动力，但还有其他因素。
[00:09.132] Compassion is one of these. | 怜悯就是其中之一。
[00:11.952] Tentatively, it can be suggested that this is the main influence upon those who urge the abolition of capital punishment. | 试探性地可以说，这是那些主张废除死刑者所受的主要影响。
[00:20.122] It is recognition of compassion's parts that leads the upholders of capital punishment to accuse the abolitionists of sentimentality in being more sorry for the murderer than for his victim. | 正是对同情心的认知，使得死刑支持者指责废除死刑者过于感情用事，对凶手比对受害者更感到惋惜。
[00:33.202] This is nonsense, but with it some organs of the popular press played upon the emotions of their readers so successfully that many candidates for parliament were afraid to support abolition for fear of losing votes. | 这是胡说八道，但借此，一些大众媒体的机构成功地玩弄了读者的情感，以至于许多议会候选人因害怕失去选票而不敢支持废除死刑。
[00:46.902] And the result was the muddle-headed homicide act of 1957, which made murder with robbery a capital crime and allowed the poisoner to escape the gallows. | 结果是 1957 年的糊涂杀人法案，它将抢劫杀人定为死罪，却让投毒者逃脱了绞刑。
[00:59.202] That illogical qualification shows how flimsy is the argument that capital punishment is a deterrent to murder. | 这种不合逻辑的限定表明，死刑可以震慑谋杀的论点是多么站不住脚。
[01:07.472] The poisoner always works on a calculated plan of action, and therefore is able to consider whether or not his taking another's life is worth the risk of his own. | 投毒者总是按照精心策划的行动方案行事，因此能够考虑夺走他人生命是否值得冒自己的风险。
[01:17.472] The violent thief is usually at the mercy of an instant emotion. | 暴力盗贼通常受制于一时的情绪。
[01:23.512] The only arguable plea for capital punishment is the right of society to retribution in this world, with the prospect of life in another. | 唯一可以争论的死刑理由是社会在这个世界上进行报复的权利，以及在另一个世界生活的希望。
[01:33.202] But since what used to seem to the great majority of civilized humanity the assurance of another life beyond the grave has come to seem to more and more people less certain. | 然而，对于绝大多数文明人类来说，墓后生命曾是确定无疑的，如今却越来越多人认为它不再那么确定。
[01:43.142] A feeling for the value of human life has become deeper and more widespread. | 对人类生命价值的感受变得更深刻、更普遍。
[01:48.642] This may seem a paradoxical claim to make at a time when mankind is so much preoccupied with weapons of destruction. | 在人类如此专注于毁灭性武器的时代，这可能是一个看似矛盾的主张。
[01:56.402] Nevertheless, it is a claim that can be sustained, and if compassion animates those who urge the abolition of the death penalty, it is not a sentimental compassion for the mental agony inflicted upon a condemned man, but a dread of destroying the miracle of life. | 尽管如此，这是一个可以站得住脚的主张，如果同情心激励那些主张废除死刑的人，那它不是对被判刑者所承受的精神痛苦的感伤怜悯，而是对摧毁生命奇迹的恐惧。
[02:14.542] When in the 18th century, offenses against the law that today would not earn a month in prison were punished with a death penalty, the severity of the penal code had no serious effect on the prevalence of crime. | 在 18 世纪，那些如今不会被判处一个月监禁的违法行为却被处以死刑，但刑法的严酷性并未对犯罪的普遍性产生严重影响。
[02:28.162] When it made no difference to the fate of a highwayman whether he had killed his victim or merely robbed him of a few pieces of silver, | 当一个拦路抢劫犯的命运，无论是他杀了受害者，还是仅仅抢走了几块银子，都毫无区别时，
[02:37.332] there were no more murders then than there were when men like Sir Francis Burdett succeeded in lightning the excessive severity of the penal laws. | 当时发生的谋杀案，并不比像弗朗西斯·伯德特爵士这样的人成功减轻刑法过度严酷性时更多。
[02:46.942] In those days, the sacredness of life on Earth was not greatly regarded because the life in the world to come was taken for granted, except by a comparatively small minority of philosophers. | 在那些日子里，地球上生命的圣洁性并未受到高度重视，因为来世的生命被认为是理所当然的，除了少数哲学家。
[03:00.412] Nor was the long drawn ordeal of the condemned cell inflicted either upon the condemned man or his jailers once upon a time. | 曾经，死囚牢房的漫长折磨也未曾施加于被判刑者或其狱卒。
[03:09.912] Those who believe in capital punishment may have arguments for its retention, | 那些相信死刑的人可能会有保留死刑的理由，
[03:14.652] but surely no reasonable argument can be found for retention of the sickening mumbo jumbo that accompanies it from the moment that the judge dons the black cap with what looks like a pen wiper balanced on the top of his wig, to the reading of the burial service over the condemned man before he is dead. | 但肯定找不到任何合理的理由来保留那些令人作呕的胡言乱语，从法官戴上黑帽子（上面好像平衡着一块擦笔布）的那一刻起，直到在被判刑者尚未死去之前为他宣读葬礼仪式。
[03:33.412] Moreover, it was more merciful to launch the condemned man into eternity 24 hours after he was sentenced, than to keep him shivering on the brink of that dread gulf for nearly three weeks. | 此外，在判刑 24 小时后，将这名被判刑者送入永恒，比让他在那可怕的深渊边缘颤抖近三周要仁慈得多。
[03:46.222] Hanging is an atrociously archaic way of killing a human being, | 绞刑是一种极其古老的杀人方式，
[03:50.132] and the self-satisfied modernity of the electric chair is just as atrocious. | 而电椅自以为是的现代性也同样残忍。
[03:56.242] The administration of a strong sleeping draft to the condemned man every night from which one night he does not awake, seems a more civilized alternative to our present barbarous procedure if capital punishment through the influence of backward minds be retained. | 如果死刑因落后思想的影响而得以保留，那么每天晚上给被判刑者服用强效安眠药，让他在一个夜晚不再醒来，似乎比我们目前野蛮的程序更文明。
[04:13.912] Compton McKenzie. | 康普顿·麦肯齐。
[04:16.202] On Moral Courage. | 论道德勇气。
