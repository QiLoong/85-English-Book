[00:02.920]Science and technology have come to pervade every aspect of our lives, | 科学技术已经渗透到我们生活的方方面面，
[00:07.130]and, as a result, society is changing at a speed which is quite unprecedented. | 结果，社会正以一种前所未有的速度发生变化。
[00:13.310]There is a great technological explosion around us, generated by science. | 科学在我们周围引发了一场巨大的技术爆炸。
[00:19.460]This explosion is already freeing vast numbers of people from their traditional bondage to nature. | 这场爆炸已经将大量人口从他们对自然的传统束缚中解放出来。
[00:25.330]And now at last we have it in our power to free mankind once and for all from the fear which is based on want. | 现在我们终于有能力将人类彻底从基于匮乏的恐惧中解放出来。

[01:36.420]We have considerably extended our expectation of life. | 我们已大大延长了预期寿命。
[01:40.450]We have enriched our lives by creating physical mobility through the motor car, the jet airplane, and other means of mechanical transport. | 我们通过汽车、喷气式飞机和其他机械运输方式创造了身体上的移动性，从而丰富了我们的生活。
[01:49.200]And we have added to our intellectual mobility by the telephone, radio and television. | 我们通过电话、广播和电视增加了智力上的流动性。
[01:55.390]Not content with these advances, we are now thrusting forward to the stars. | 不满足于这些进步，我们现在正向星辰挺进。
[02:00.170]And the conquest of space no longer strikes us as Wellsian or Jules Vernian. | 征服太空对我们来说不再是威尔斯式的或凡尔纳式的幻想。
[02:05.470]And with the advent of the new phase of technology we call automation, | 随着我们称之为自动化的新阶段技术的到来，
[02:09.610]we have the promise both of greater leisure and of even greater material and intellectual riches. | 我们既有望获得更多的闲暇时间，也有望获得更大的物质和智力财富。
[02:16.480]But this is not inevitable. | 但这并非不可避免。
[02:18.270]It depends on automation being adequately exploited. | 这取决于自动化能否得到充分利用。
[02:22.120]We shall need to apply our scientific and technological resources to literally every aspect of our society, | 我们需要将我们的科学技术资源应用于我们社会的每一个方面，
[02:28.180]to our commerce, our industry, our medicine, our agriculture, our transportation. | 包括我们的商业、工业、医学、农业和交通运输。
[02:34.960]It is fascinating and encouraging to observe the development of this immense process. | 观察这一巨大过程的发展是令人着迷和鼓舞的。

[03:14.620]If this observation is accurate, as I believe it is, | 如果这一观察是准确的，正如我所相信的那样，
[03:18.300]the implications are far-reaching. | 其影响是深远的。
