[00:04.570]We can read of things that happened 5,000 years ago in the Near East, | 我们可以读到5000年前近东发生的事情，
[00:08.570]where people first learned to write. | 那里的人们首次学会了书写。
[00:11.670]But there are some parts of the world where even now people cannot write. | 但世界上有些地方，即使是现在，人们也无法书写。
[00:16.170]The only way they can preserve their history is to recount it as sagas, | 他们保存历史的唯一方法是将其作为传奇故事、
[00:20.670]legends, handed down from one generation of storytellers to another. | 传说来讲述，由一代代讲故事的人传给下一代。
[00:26.070]These legends are useful because they can tell us something about migrations of people who lived long ago, | 这些传说很有用，因为它们可以告诉我们一些关于很久以前生活的人们的迁徙，
[00:31.770]but none could write down what they did. | 但没有人能写下他们所做的事情。
[00:34.770]Anthropologists wondered where the remote ancestors of the Polynesian peoples now living in the Pacific Islands came from. | 人类学家想知道现在生活在太平洋岛屿上的波利尼西亚人的远古祖先来自哪里。
[00:41.670]The sagas of these people explain that some of them came from Indonesia about 2,000 years ago. | 这些民族的传说解释说，他们中的一些人大约在2000年前来自印度尼西亚。
[00:48.370]But the first people who were like ourselves lived so long ago that even their sagas, | 但那些像我们一样的第一批人生活在如此久远的过去，以至于即使他们的传说，
[00:53.670]if they had any, are forgotten. | 如果他们有的话，也已被遗忘。
[00:56.370]So, archaeologists have neither history nor legends to help them to find out where the first modern men came from. | 因此，考古学家既没有历史也没有传说来帮助他们找出第一批现代人来自哪里。
[01:04.570]Fortunately, however, ancient men made tools of stone, especially flint, | 然而幸运的是，古代人类制造了石器，特别是燧石，
[01:09.170]because this is easier to shape than other kinds. | 因为燧石比其他类型的石头更容易塑形。
[01:13.470]They may also have used wood and skins, but these have rotted away. | 他们可能也使用过木材和兽皮，但这些都已腐烂。
[01:18.070]Stone does not decay. | 石头不会腐烂。
[01:20.070]And so the tools of long ago have remained when even the bones of the men who made them have disappeared without trace. | 因此，很久以前的工具得以保存下来，即使制造它们的人的骨骼也已消失得无影无踪。
[01:28.170]Robin Place, | 罗宾·普莱斯，
[01:29.870]Finding Fossil Man. | 寻找化石人。
