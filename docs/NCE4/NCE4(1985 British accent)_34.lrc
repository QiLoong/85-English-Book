[00:00.673] Passage 34 | 第34段
[00:02.833] This is a skeptical age. | 这是一个怀疑的时代。
[00:04.833] But although our faith in many of the things in which our forefathers fervently believed has weakened, | 尽管我们对祖先曾热切相信的许多事物失去信心，
[00:11.093] our confidence in the curative properties of the bottle of medicine remains the same as theirs. | 但我们对药瓶中药物的疗效信心不减，和他们一样。
[00:17.653] This modern faith in medicines is proved by the fact that the annual drug bill of the health services is mounting to astronomical figures | 这种现代人对药物的信仰，体现在医疗服务年度药品支出已达到天文数字，
[00:27.023] and shows no signs at present of ceasing to rise. | 并且目前没有停止增长的迹象。
[00:32.263] The majority of the patients attending the medical out-patients departments of our hospitals feel that they have not received adequate treatment, | 我们医院门诊部的绝大多数病人都觉得他们没有得到足够的治疗，
[00:40.543] unless they are able to carry home with them some tangible remedy in the shape of a bottle of medicine, a box of pills, or a small jar of ointment. | 除非他们能带回家一些以药瓶、药盒或小罐药膏形式出现的具体药物。
[00:51.033] And the doctor in charge of the department is only too ready to provide them with these requirements. | 而科室负责人也乐于满足他们的这些要求。
[00:57.173] There is no quicker method of disposing of patients than by giving them what they are asking for. | 没有比满足患者要求更能迅速打发他们的办法了。
[01:03.493] And since most medical men in the health services are overworked and have little time for offering time-consuming and little-appreciated advice on such subjects as diet, right living, and the need for abandoning bad habits, etc., | 鉴于医疗服务中的大多数医务人员工作过度，很少有时间提供耗时且不被重视的饮食、健康生活和戒除坏习惯等方面的建议，
[01:18.573] the bottle, the box, and the jar are almost always granted them. | 药瓶、药盒和药膏几乎总是会给他们。
[01:24.453] Nor is it only the ignorant and ill-educated person who has such faith in the bottle of medicine, | 并非只有无知和缺乏教育的人才对药瓶有如此的信仰，
[01:30.463] especially if it be wrapped in white paper and sealed with a dab of red sealing wax by a clever chemist. | 尤其是如果它被聪明的药剂师用白纸包裹并用红色火漆封住。
[01:37.953] It is recounted of Thomas Carlyle that when he heard of the illness of his friend, Henry Taylor, | 据说，托马斯·卡莱尔在听说他的朋友亨利·泰勒生病时，
[01:43.833] he went off immediately to visit him, | 立刻赶去探望他，
[01:46.543] carrying with him in his pocket what remained of a bottle of medicine formerly prescribed for an indisposition of Mrs. Carlyle's. | 口袋里带着一瓶药的剩余部分，这药曾是为卡莱尔夫人的小恙开的。
[01:55.253] Carlyle was entirely ignorant of what the bottle in his pocket contained, | 卡莱尔完全不知道他口袋里的药瓶装着什么，
[02:00.083] of the nature of the illness from which his friend was suffering, and of what had previously been wrong with his wife. | 也不知道他的朋友患的是什么病，更不知道他妻子以前有什么毛病。
[02:06.663] But a medicine that had worked so well in one form of illness would surely be of equal benefit in another. | 但一种在一种疾病形式上效果如此好的药，肯定在另一种疾病上也能带来同样的益处。
[02:13.293] And comforted by the thought of the help he was bringing to his friend, he hastened to Henry Taylor's house. | 他被自己给朋友带来帮助的想法所安慰，急忙赶往亨利·泰勒的家。
[02:20.663] History does not relate whether his friend accepted his medical help, but in all probability he did. | 历史没有记载他的朋友是否接受了他的医疗帮助，但很可能接受了。
[02:27.423] The great advantage of taking medicine is that it makes no demands on the taker beyond that of putting up for a moment with a disgusting taste, | 服药的最大好处是，除了忍受片刻令人作呕的味道外，它对服用者没有其他要求，
[02:36.333] and that is what all patients demand of their doctors: | 这正是所有患者对医生提出的要求：
[02:39.523] to be cured at no inconvenience to themselves. | 在不给自己带来任何不便的情况下痊愈。
