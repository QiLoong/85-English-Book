[00:00.000]Passage 9. | 第九段。
[00:01.890]Not all sounds made by animals serve as language. | 并非所有动物发出的声音都充当语言。
[00:05.150]And we've only to turn to the extraordinary discovery of echolocation in bats, | 我们只需研究蝙蝠回声定位的非凡发现，
[00:10.020]to see a case in which the voice plays a strictly utilitarian role. | 就能看到一个声音扮演纯粹实用角色的例子。
[00:15.170]To get a fuller appreciation of what this means, | 要更全面地理解这意味着什么，
[00:18.330]we must turn first to some recent human inventions. | 我们必须首先转向一些近期的人类发明。
[00:22.560]Everyone knows that if he shouts in the vicinity of a wall or a mountainside, | 每个人都知道，如果在墙壁或山坡附近喊叫，
[00:26.960]an echo will come back. | 会有回声。
[00:28.450]The further off this solid obstruction, | 固体障碍物越远，
[00:30.640]the longer time will elapse for the return of the echo. | 回声返回所需的时间就越长。
[00:34.500]A sound made by tapping on the hull of a ship will be reflected from the sea bottom, | 敲击船体发出的声音会从海底反射回来，
[00:39.460]and by measuring the time interval between the taps and the receipt of the echoes, | 通过测量敲击声和回声之间的时间间隔，
[00:44.020]the depth of the sea at that point can be calculated. | 就可以计算出该点的海深。
[00:47.380]So was born the echo sounding apparatus, | 于是，回声测深仪诞生了，
[00:50.040]and now in general use in ships. | 现在已广泛用于船舶。
[00:53.200]Every solid object will reflect a sound, | 每个固体物体都会反射声音，
[00:55.380]varying according to the size and nature of the object. | 反射情况因物体的大小和性质而异。
[00:59.450]A shoal of fish will do this. | 鱼群也会这样做。
[01:02.160]So, it is a comparatively simple step from locating the sea bottom to locating a shoal of fish. | 因此，从定位海底到定位鱼群，是一个相对简单的步骤。
[01:08.560]With experience and with improved apparatus, | 凭借经验和改进的设备，
[01:11.870]it's now possible not only to locate a shoal, | 现在不仅可以定位鱼群，
[01:14.900]but to tell if it is herring, cod, or other well-known fish by the pattern of its echo. | 还可以根据回声的模式判断它是鲱鱼、鳕鱼还是其他常见鱼类。
[01:21.080]A few years ago, it was found that certain bats emit squeaks, | 几年前，人们发现某些蝙蝠会发出吱吱声，
[01:25.170]and by receiving the echoes, they could locate and steer clear of obstacles, | 通过接收回声，它们可以定位并避开障碍物，
[01:30.080]or locate flying insects on which they feed. | 或者定位它们捕食的飞虫。
[01:33.300]This echolocation in bats is often compared with radar, | 蝙蝠的这种回声定位常与雷达相比较，
[01:37.380]the principle of which is similar. | 两者的原理相似。
