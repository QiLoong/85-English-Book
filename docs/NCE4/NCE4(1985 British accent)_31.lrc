[00:00.000] Part two. | 第二部分。
[00:01.825] Unit 4, Passage 31. | 第4单元，第31篇文章。
[00:04.700] Many people in industry and the services who've practically experienced of noise, | 许多在工业和服务业中亲身经历过噪音的人，
[00:09.910] regard any investigation of this question as a waste of time. | 都认为调查这个问题是浪费时间。
[00:14.280] They're not prepared even to admit the possibility that noise affects people. | 他们甚至不愿承认噪音会影响人的可能性。
[00:18.570] On the other hand, those who dislike noise will sometimes use most inadequate evidence to support their pleas for a quieter society. | 另一方面，那些不喜欢噪音的人有时会利用最不充分的证据来支持他们对一个更安静社会的要求。
[00:26.560] This is a pity because noise abatement really is a good cause, | 这很遗憾，因为噪音消除确实是一项很好的事业，
[00:30.360] and it's likely to be discredited if it gets to be associated with bad science. | 如果它与糟糕的科学联系在一起，它很可能会失去信誉。
[00:36.140] One allegation often made is that noise produces mental illness. | 常见的一种指控是噪音会导致精神疾病。
[00:40.400] A recent article in a weekly newspaper, for instance, | 例如，最近一份周报上的一篇文章，
[00:42.870] was headed with a striking illustration of a lady in a state of considerable distress | 配有一幅醒目的插图，描绘了一位处于极度痛苦中的女士，
[00:47.530] with the caption | 标题写道：
[00:48.870] she was yet another victim reduced to a screaming wreck. | 她是又一个被折磨得尖叫不止的受害者。
[00:52.680] On turning eagerly to the text, one learns that the lady was a typist | 当人们急切地翻阅文本时，发现这位女士是一名打字员，
[00:56.590] who found the sound of office typewriters worried her more and more | 她发现办公室打字机的声音让她越来越烦恼，
[01:00.860] until eventually, she had to go into a mental hospital. | 直到最终，她不得不住进精神病院。
[01:04.370] Now, the snag in this sort of anecdote is of course that one cannot distinguish cause and effect. | 这种轶事的症结当然在于无法区分因果关系。
[01:10.030] Was the noise a cause of the illness, | 噪音是疾病的原因，
[01:11.750] or were the complaints about noise merely a symptom? | 还是对噪音的抱怨仅仅是一种症状？
[01:15.540] Another patient might equally well complain that her neighbors were combining to slander her and persecute her. | 另一位病人也可能会抱怨她的邻居合伙诽谤和迫害她。
[01:22.370] And yet one might be cautious about believing this statement. | 然而，人们可能会对相信这种说法持谨慎态度。
[01:26.790] What is needed in the case of noise is a study of large numbers of people living under noisy conditions | 对于噪音，我们需要做的是研究大量在嘈杂环境中生活的人，
[01:32.700] to discover whether they are mentally ill more often than other people are. | 发现他们是否比其他人更容易患精神疾病。
[01:37.470] The United States Navy, for instance, recently examined a very large number of men working on aircraft carriers. | 例如，美国海军最近检查了大量在航空母舰上工作的男性。
[01:44.570] The study was known as Project Anahin. | 这项研究被称为“阿纳欣项目”。
[01:47.800] It can be unpleasant to live even several miles from an aerodrome. | 即使住在离机场几英里远的地方也会让人不舒服。
[01:51.270] If you think what it must be like to share the deck of a ship with several squadrons of jet aircraft, | 如果你想到与几个中队的喷气式飞机共享一艘船的甲板会是什么样子，
[01:56.630] you will realize that a modern Navy is a good place to study noise. | 你就会意识到现代海军是研究噪音的好地方。
[02:00.560] But neither psychiatric interviews nor objective tests were able to show any effects upon these American sailors. | 但无论是精神病学访谈还是客观测试，都未能显示出对这些美国水兵的任何影响。
[02:08.060] This result merely confirms earlier American and British studies. | 这一结果仅仅证实了早些时候美国和英国的研究。
[02:13.520] If there is any effect of noise upon mental health, | 如果噪音对精神健康有任何影响，
[02:15.650] it must be so small that present methods of psychiatric diagnosis cannot find it. | 那也一定微乎其微，以至于目前的精神病诊断方法无法发现它。
[02:22.180] That does not prove that it does not exist, | 这并不能证明它不存在，
[02:24.780] but it does mean that noise is less dangerous than say being brought up in an orphanage, | 但它确实意味着噪音的危险性不如在孤儿院长大，
[02:29.610] which really is a mental health hazard. | 那才真正是精神健康隐患。
