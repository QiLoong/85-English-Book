[00:00.000] Passage 23. | 篇章 23。
[00:01.760] It's fairly clear that the sleeping period must have some function. | 睡眠期肯定具有某种功能。
[00:06.460] And because there is so much of it, the function would seem to be important. | 而且由于睡眠期很长，这种功能似乎很重要。
[00:11.720] Speculations about its nature have been going on for literally thousands of years. | 关于其性质的猜测已经持续了几千年。
[00:17.940] And one odd finding that makes the problem puzzling is that it looks very much as if sleeping is not simply a matter of giving the body a rest. | 一个令人费解的奇怪发现是，睡眠似乎不仅仅是让身体休息。
[00:28.320] Rest in terms of muscle relaxation and so on can be achieved by a brief period lying or even sitting down. | 肌肉放松等方面的休息可以通过短暂的躺卧甚至坐着来实现。
[00:37.420] The body's tissues are self-repairing and self-restoring to a degree and function best when more or less continuously active. | 身体的组织在一定程度上是自我修复和自我恢复的，并且在或多或少持续活动时功能最佳。
[00:46.700] In fact, a basic amount of movement occurs during sleep, which is specifically concerned with preventing muscle inactivity. | 事实上，睡眠期间会发生一定程度的运动，这尤其与防止肌肉不活动有关。
[00:55.560] If it is not a question of resting the body, then perhaps it's the brain that needs resting. | 如果这不是身体休息的问题，那么也许是大脑需要休息。
[01:01.760] This might be a plausible hypothesis, would it not for two factors. | 如果不是因为两个因素，这可能是一个合理的假设。
[01:06.100] First, the electroencephalograph, which is simply a device for recording the electrical activity of the brain by attaching electrodes to the scalp, | 首先，脑电图仪，它只是一个通过将电极连接到头皮来记录大脑电活动的设备，
[01:15.000] shows that while there is a change in the pattern of activity during sleep, there is no evidence that the total amount of activity is any less. | 表明虽然睡眠期间活动模式发生变化，但没有证据表明总活动量有所减少。
[01:24.700] The second factor is more interesting and more fundamental. | 第二个因素更有趣，也更根本。
[01:29.400] In 1960, an American psychiatrist named William Dement published experiments dealing with the recording of eye movements during sleep. | 1960 年，一位名叫威廉·德门特的美国精神病学家发表了关于记录睡眠期间眼球运动的实验。
[01:39.880] He showed that the average individual sleep cycle is punctuated with peculiar bursts of eye movements, some drifting and slow, others jerky and rapid. | 他表明，平均每个人的睡眠周期都伴随着独特的眼球运动爆发，有些漂移缓慢，有些则抽搐快速。
[01:50.180] People woken during these periods of eye movements generally reported that they had been dreaming. | 在这些眼球运动期间被唤醒的人通常报告说他们一直在做梦。
[01:57.100] When woken at other times, they reported no dreams. | 在其他时间被唤醒时，他们报告说没有梦。
[02:01.300] If one group of people were disturbed from their eye movement sleep for several nights on end, and another group were disturbed for an equal period of time, but when they were not exhibiting eye movements, the first group began to show some personality disorders, while the others seemed more or less unaffected. | 如果一组人在连续几个晚上从眼球运动睡眠中被干扰，而另一组人在相同的时间段内被干扰，但当他们没有表现出眼球运动时，第一组开始表现出一些人格障碍，而另一组则或多或少没有受到影响。
[02:19.460] The implications of all this were that it was not the disturbance of sleep that mattered, but the disturbance of dreaming. | 所有这一切的含义是，重要的不是睡眠的干扰，而是做梦的干扰。
[02:26.980] Christopher Evans, the stuff of dreams from the listener. | 克里斯托弗·埃文斯，《听众》中的梦境内容。
