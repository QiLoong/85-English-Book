[00:00.231] Passage 25. | 第25段。
[00:02.401] How it came about that snakes manufactured poison is a mystery. | 蛇是如何制造毒液的，至今仍是一个谜。
[00:06.951] Over the periods, their saliva, a mild digestive juice just like our own, was converted into a poison that defies analysis even today. | 经过漫长的时期，它们的唾液——一种像我们自己的消化液一样温和的液体——转化为一种毒液，即使在今天也难以分析其成分。
[00:01.921] It was not forced upon them by the survival competition. | 这并非是生存竞争强加给它们的。
[00:20.641] They could have caught and lived on prey without using poison, just as the thousands of non-poisonous snakes still do. | 它们完全可以在不使用毒液的情况下捕捉猎物并以此为生，就像成千上万的无毒蛇现在仍在做的那样。
[00:28.531] Poison to a snake is merely a luxury. | 对于蛇来说，毒液只是一种奢侈品。
[00:31.731] It enables it to get its food with very little effort, no more effort than one bite. | 它让蛇能够不费吹灰之力地获取食物，只需一口即可。
[00:38.211] And why only snakes? | 那么，为什么只有蛇会制造毒液呢？
[00:40.411] Cats for instance would be greatly helped. | 例如，猫如果拥有毒液将大有帮助。
[00:43.51] No running fights with large fierce rats or tussles with grown rabbits. | 不用与凶猛的大老鼠搏斗，也不用与成年兔子纠缠。
[00:47.491] Just a bite and no more effort needed. | 只需一口，便无需再费力气。
[00:51.101] In fact, it would be an assistance to all the Carnivora, though it would be a two-edged weapon when they fought each other. | 事实上，对于所有的食肉动物来说，毒液都会有所帮助，尽管当它们自相残杀时，这将是一把双刃剑。
[00:58.301] But of the vertebrates, unpredictable nature selected only snakes and one lizard. | 然而在脊椎动物中，不可预测的大自然只选择了蛇和一种蜥蜴。
[01:05.141] One wonders also if why nature with some snakes concocted poison of such extreme potency. | 人们还想知道，为什么大自然让某些蛇制造出如此剧毒的毒液。
[01:12.471] In the conversion of saliva into poison, one might suppose that a fixed process took place. | 在唾液转化为毒液的过程中，人们可能会认为发生了一个固定的过程。
[01:18.781] It did not. | 事实并非如此。
[01:20.201] Some snakes manufactured a poison different in every respect from that of others. | 有些蛇制造的毒液在各个方面都与其他蛇的不同。
[01:25.21] As different as arsenic is from strychnine and having different effects. | 就像砷与士的宁一样截然不同，而且具有不同的效果。
[01:30.171] One poison acts on the nerves, the other on the blood. | 一种毒液作用于神经，另一种作用于血液。
[01:35.561] The maker of the nerve poison includes the mambas and the cobras and their venom is called neurotoxic. | 神经毒液的制造者包括曼巴蛇和眼镜蛇，它们的毒液被称为神经毒素。
[01:42.511] Vipers, adders, and rattlesnakes manufacture the blood poison, which is known as hemolytic. | 蝰蛇、蝮蛇和响尾蛇制造血液毒液，这种毒液被称为溶血毒素。
[01:50.391] Both poisons are unpleasant, but by far the more unpleasant is the blood poison. | 两种毒液都不好，但更糟糕的无疑是血液毒液。
[01:56.31] It is said that the nerve poison is the more primitive of the two. | 据说神经毒液是两者中更原始的一种。
[02:00.391] That the blood poison is, so to speak, a newer product from an improved formula. | 而血液毒液，可以说是一种经过改良配方的新产品。
[02:05.951] Be that as it may, the nerve poison does its business with man far more quickly than the blood poison. | 尽管如此，神经毒液对人类的作用比血液毒液要快得多。
[02:12.351] This however means nothing. | 然而，这并不意味着什么。
[02:14.481] Snakes did not acquire their poison for use against man, but for use against prey such as rats and mice, and the effects on these of viperine poison is almost immediate. | 蛇获得毒液并非为了对抗人类，而是为了对抗老鼠等猎物，而蝰蛇毒液对这些猎物的作用几乎是立竿见影的。
