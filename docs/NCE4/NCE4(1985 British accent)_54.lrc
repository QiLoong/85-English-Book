[00:00.672] Passage 54. | 文章 54。
[00:02.772] We must conclude from the work of those who have studied the origin of life | 我们必须从那些研究生命起源的人的工作中得出结论，
[00:07.032] that given a planet only approximately like our own, life is almost certain to start. | 即只要行星大致与我们自己的相似，生命几乎肯定会开始。
[00:12.722] Of all the planets in our own solar system, we are now pretty certain the Earth is the only one on which life can survive. | 在我们自己的太阳系中所有行星里，我们现在相当确定地球是唯一一个生命可以存活的星球。
[00:20.102] Mars is too dry and poor in oxygen, | 火星太干燥，氧气稀薄；
[00:23.002] Venus far too hot, and so is Mercury. | 金星太热，水星也是。
[00:25.922] And the outer planets have temperatures near absolute zero and hydrogen dominated atmospheres. | 而外行星的温度接近绝对零度，大气层主要由氢组成。
[00:32.612] But other suns, stars as the astronomers call them, | 但是，其他的恒星，天文学家称之为星星，
[00:36.192] are bound to have planets like our own. | 必然会有像我们自己的行星。
[00:38.672] And as the number of stars in the universe is so vast, | 鉴于宇宙中恒星的数量如此庞大，
[04:02.942] and absurdly wandering the streets in the hope of a chance encounter. | 只是荒谬地在街上游荡，希望能偶然相遇。
[04:06.562] Antony Michaelis. | 安东尼·米切利斯。
[04:08.562] Are there strangers in space? | 太空中有陌生人吗？
[04:11.022] From the Weekend Telegraph. | 摘自《周末电讯报》。
[00:41.872] this possibility becomes virtual certainty. | 这种可能性几乎成了必然。
[00:45.622] There are 100,000 million stars in our own Milky Way alone. | 仅在我们自己的银河系中就有1000亿颗恒星。
[00:50.452] And then there are 3,000 million other Milky Ways or galaxies in the universe. | 此外，宇宙中还有30亿个其他银河系或星系。
[00:56.882] So the number of stars that we know exist is now estimated at about 300 million million million. | 因此，我们已知存在的恒星数量现在估计约为300亿亿亿颗。
[01:05.412] Although perhaps only 1% of the life that has started somewhere will develop into highly complex and intelligent patterns, | 尽管在某个地方开始的生命中，也许只有1%会发展成高度复杂和智能的模式，
[01:12.442] so vast is the number of planets that intelligent life is bound to be a natural part of the universe. | 但行星的数量如此之多，以至于智能生命必然是宇宙的自然组成部分。
[01:19.982] If then we are so certain that other intelligent life exists in the universe, | 如果我们如此确定宇宙中存在其他智能生命，
[01:24.872] why have we had no visitors from outer space yet? | 那为什么我们还没有外太空的访客呢？
[01:29.072] First of all, they may have come to this planet of ours thousands or millions of years ago, | 首先，他们可能在几千或几百万年前就来过我们的星球，
[01:34.562] and found our then prevailing primitive state completely uninteresting to their own advanced knowledge. | 并发现我们当时普遍存在的原始状态，对于他们先进的知识来说完全不感兴趣。
[01:41.522] Professor Ronald Bracewell, a leading American radio astronomer, | 罗纳德·布雷斯韦尔教授，一位杰出的美国射电天文学家，
[01:46.402] argued in Nature that such a superior civilization on a visit to our own solar system | 在《自然》杂志上提出，这样一个更高级的文明在访问我们自己的太阳系时，
[01:52.792] may have left an automatic messenger behind to await the possible awakening of an advanced civilization. | 可能留下了一个自动信使，以等待一个先进文明的可能觉醒。
[02:00.082] Such a messenger, receiving our radio and television signals, | 这样一个信使，接收到我们的无线电和电视信号后，
[02:04.282] might well retransmit them back to its home planet, | 很可能会将它们重新传输回其母星，
[02:07.482] although what impression any other civilization would thus get from us is best left unsaid. | 尽管其他文明会因此对我们产生何种印象最好不提。
[02:13.682] But here we come up against the most difficult of all obstacles to contact with people on other planets: | 但在这里，我们遇到了与外星人接触的最大障碍：
[02:19.492] the astronomical distances which separate us. | 隔开我们的天文距离。
[02:23.232] As a reasonable guess, they might, on an average, be 100 light years away. | 合理猜测，他们平均可能在100光年之外。
[02:28.772] A light year is the distance which light travels at 160,000 miles per second in one year, | 一光年是光以每秒16万英里的速度，在一年内所走的距离，
[02:35.332] namely 6 million million miles. | 即6万亿英里。
[02:39.522] Radio waves also travel at the speed of light, | 无线电波也以光速传播，
[02:42.502] and assuming such an automatic messenger picked up our first broadcasts of the 1920s, | 假设这样一个自动信使接收到了我们20世纪20年代的首次广播，
[02:48.332] the message to its home planet is barely halfway there. | 那么发往其母星的信息才刚刚走到一半。
[02:52.772] Similarly, our own present primitive chemical rockets, | 同样，我们目前原始的化学火箭，
[02:56.242] though good enough to orbit men, have no chance of transporting us to the nearest other star four light years away, | 尽管足以将人类送入轨道，但却无法将我们运送到四光年之外最近的另一颗恒星，
[03:03.272] let alone distances of tens or hundreds of light years. | 更不用说几十或几百光年的距离了。
[03:07.722] Fortunately, there is a uniquely rational way for us to communicate with other intelligent beings, | 幸运的是，有一种独特的合理方式供我们与其他智能生物进行交流，
[03:13.562] as Walter Sullivan has put it in his excellent recent book, 'We Are Not Alone'. | 正如沃尔特·沙利文在他最近的优秀著作《我们不孤单》中所说。
[03:19.662] This depends on the precise radio frequency of the 21 cm wavelength, | 这取决于21厘米波长的精确无线电频率，
[03:24.972] or 1,420 megacycles per second. | 即每秒1420兆赫。
[03:29.672] It is the natural frequency of emission of the hydrogen atoms in space, | 它是太空中氢原子辐射的自然频率，
[03:34.202] and was discovered by us in 1951. | 并且于1951年被我们发现。
[03:37.522] It must be known to any kind of radio astronomer in the universe. | 宇宙中任何一种射电天文学家都必定知道它。
[03:42.572] Once the existence of this wavelength had been discovered, | 一旦发现这种波长的存在，
[03:45.742] it was not long before its use as a uniquely recognizable broadcasting frequency for interstellar communication was suggested. | 很快就有人建议将其用作星际通信中一种独特的可识别广播频率。
[03:53.962] Without something of this kind, searching for intelligences on other planets | 如果没有这类方法，在其他行星上寻找智能生命，
[03:58.262] would be like trying to meet a friend in London without a prearranged rendezvous, | 就像在伦敦想见朋友却没有预先约好，
