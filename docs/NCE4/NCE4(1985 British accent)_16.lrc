[00:00.835] Passage 16 | 第16段
[00:02.835] The deepest holes of all are made for oil, | 所有最深的孔都是为石油而钻的，
[00:05.675] and they go down to as much as 25,000 feet. | 深度可达25,000英尺。
[00:09.915] But we do not need to send men down to get the oil out, | 但我们不需要派人下去把油取出来，
[00:13.885] as we must with other mineral deposits. | 就像我们处理其他矿藏一样。
[00:17.655] The holes are only borings, less than a foot in diameter. | 这些孔只是钻孔，直径不到一英尺。
[00:22.955] My particular experience is largely in oil, | 我的特殊经验主要是在石油领域，
[00:26.375] and the search for oil has done more to improve deep drilling than any other mining activity. | 寻找石油的工作比任何其他采矿活动都更能改善深井钻探。
[00:34.345] When it has been decided where we are going to drill, | 当决定好在哪里钻探时，
[00:37.755] we put up at the surface an oil derrick. | 我们会在地表搭建一个采油井架。
[00:42.595] It has to be tall because it is like a giant block and tackle, | 它必须很高，因为它就像一个巨大的滑轮组，
[00:46.395] and we have to lower into the ground and haul out of the ground great lengths of drill pipe, which are rotated by an engine at the top, and are fitted with a cutting bit at the bottom. | 我们必须将很长的钻杆下入地下并从地下吊出，这些钻杆由顶部的发动机旋转，底部装有钻头。
[00:59.505] The geologist needs to know what rocks the drill has reached. | 地质学家需要知道钻头到达了哪些岩石。
[01:04.285] So every so often a sample is obtained with a coring bit. | 因此，每隔一段时间，就会用取心钻头获取一个样本。
[01:09.135] It cuts a clean cylinder of rock from which can be seen the strata the drill has been cutting through. | 它切下一块干净的圆柱形岩石，从中可以看到钻头穿过的地层。
[01:16.895] Once we get down to the oil, it usually flows to the surface because great pressure, either from gas or water, is pushing it. | 一旦我们到达石油层，它通常会流到地表，因为巨大的压力，无论是来自气体还是水，都在推动它。
[01:27.465] This pressure must be under control, | 这种压力必须受到控制，
[01:30.295] and we control it by means of the mud which we circulate down the drill pipe. | 我们通过在钻杆中循环泥浆来控制它。
[01:36.705] We endeavor to avoid the old romantic idea of a gusher which wastes oil and gas. | 我们努力避免那种浪费石油和天然气的老式喷井的浪漫想法。
[01:43.715] We want it to stay down the hole until we can lead it off in a controlled manner. | 我们希望它留在井下，直到我们能以受控的方式将其引出。
