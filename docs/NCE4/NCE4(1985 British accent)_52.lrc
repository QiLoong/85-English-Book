[00:00.627] Passage 52 | 第52篇
[00:02.737] An earthquake comes like a thief in the night without warning. | 地震就像夜间的盗贼，不打招呼就来了。
[00:06.337] It was necessary therefore to invent instruments that neither slumbered nor slept. | 因此，有必要发明一种既不打盹也不睡觉的仪器。
[00:11.757] Some devices were quite simple. | 有些装置相当简单。
[00:14.077] One, for instance, consisted of rods of various lengths and thicknesses, | 例如，其中一种装置由不同长度和厚度的杆组成，
[00:18.067] which would stand up on end like ninepins. | 它们像九柱戏的木柱一样直立。
[00:20.677] When a shock came, | 当震动来临时，
[00:21.607] it shook the rigid table upon which these stood. | 它会震动这些杆子所立的坚硬桌子。
[00:25.757] If it were gentle, only the more unstable rods fell. | 如果震动轻微，只有那些较不稳定的杆子会倒下。
[00:29.477] If it was severe, they all fell. | 如果震动剧烈，它们都会倒下。
[00:31.757] Thus the rods by falling, | 因此，这些杆子通过倒下，
[00:33.407] and by the direction in which they fell, | 以及它们倒下的方向，
[00:35.797] recorded for the slumbering scientist the strength of a shock that was too weak to awaken him, | 为昏睡中的科学家记录下了一种震动的强度，这种震动太弱以至于无法唤醒他，
[00:40.407] and the direction from which it came. | 以及震动传来的方向。
[00:43.987] But instruments far more delicate than that were needed, | 但如果想要取得任何真正重要的进展，
[00:46.397] if any really serious advance was to be made. | 就需要比这更精密的仪器。
[00:50.087] The ideal to be aimed at was to devise an instrument | 理想的目标是设计一种仪器，
[00:51.997] that could record with a pen on paper | 能够用笔在纸上记录下
[00:55.247] the movements of the ground or of the table as the quake passed by. | 地面或桌子在地震发生时的运动。
[01:01.387] While I write, my pen moves, but the paper keeps still. | 当我书写时，我的笔在动，但纸是静止的。
[01:05.177] With practice, no doubt, I could in time learn to write by holding the pen still while the paper moved. | 毫无疑问，经过练习，我总有一天可以学会，在纸移动的时候，我的笔保持不动来书写。
[01:11.087] That sounds a silly suggestion. | 这听起来是个愚蠢的建议。
[01:12.927] But that was precisely the idea adopted in some of the early instruments, | 但这正是早期一些仪器——
[01:16.487] seismometers, for recording earthquake waves. | 即地震仪——用于记录地震波所采用的理念。
[01:21.087] But when table, penholder and paper are all moving, | 但是，当桌子、笔架和纸都在移动时，
[01:24.167] how is it possible to write legibly? | 又怎么可能清晰地书写呢？
[01:27.427] The key to a solution of that problem | 解决这个问题的关键
[01:29.237] lay in an everyday observation. | 在于一个日常观察。
[01:32.327] Why does a person standing in a bus or train | 为什么一个人站在公共汽车或火车上，
[01:34.717] tend to fall when a sudden start is made? | 当车辆突然启动时，会倾向于跌倒？
[01:37.477] It is because his feet move on, but his head stays still. | 这是因为他的脚随着车辆移动，但头部却保持静止。
[01:42.17] A simple experiment will help us a little further. | 一个简单的实验会帮助我们进一步理解。
[01:44.977] Tie a heavy weight at the end of a long piece of string. | 将一个重物系在一根长绳的末端。
[01:48.477] With the hand held high in the air, | 将手举高在空中，
[01:50.157] hold the string so that the weight nearly touches the ground. | 握住绳子，使重物几乎接触地面。
[01:54.197] Now move the hand to and fro and round, | 现在将手来回、环绕移动，
[01:57.237] but not up and down. | 但不要上下移动。
[01:59.397] It will be found that the weight moves but slightly or not at all. | 会发现重物只会轻微移动，甚至根本不动。
[02:03.187] Imagine a pen attached to the weight in such a way that its point rests upon a piece of paper on the floor. | 想象一支笔以某种方式附着在重物上，笔尖落在地板上的一张纸上。
[02:09.307] Imagine an earthquake shock shaking the floor, | 想象一次地震震动了地板、
[02:11.857] the paper, you and your hand. | 纸张、你和你的手。
[02:16.327] In the midst of all this movement, the weight and the pen would be still. | 在所有这些运动中，重物和笔将是静止的。
[02:20.177] But as the paper moved from side to side under the pen point, | 但当纸在笔尖下左右移动时，
[02:23.637] its movements would be recorded in ink upon its surface. | 它的运动就会用墨水记录在纸的表面。
[02:27.357] It was upon this principle that the first instruments were made, | 最初的仪器就是基于这个原理制造的，
[02:30.337] but the paper was wrapped round a drum which rotated slowly. | 但纸是缠绕在一个缓慢旋转的鼓上。
[02:34.507] As long as all was still, the pen drew a straight line. | 只要一切静止，笔就会画出一条直线。
[02:37.897] But while the drum was being shaken, | 但当鼓被震动时，
[02:39.587] the line that the pen was drawing wiggled from side to side. | 笔所画的线就会左右摆动。
[02:43.837] The apparatus thus described, however, | 然而，这样描述的仪器，
[02:45.897] records only the horizontal component of the wave movement, | 只记录波浪运动的水平分量，
[02:49.497] which is, in fact, much more complicated. | 而实际上，波浪运动要复杂得多。
[02:54.217] If we could actually see the path described by a particle, | 如果我们能实际看到一个粒子，
[02:56.597] such as a sand grain in the rock, | 例如岩石中的一个沙粒所描述的路径，
[02:59.487] it would be more like that of a bluebottle buzzing around the room. | 它会更像一只苍蝇在房间里嗡嗡飞舞。
[03:03.577] It would be up and down, to and fro, and from side to side. | 它会上下、来回、左右移动。
[03:07.417] Instruments have been devised and can be so placed | 已经设计出仪器，并且可以这样放置，
[03:10.127] that all three elements can be recorded in different graphs. | 使所有三个分量都能在不同的图表中记录下来。
[03:14.617] When the instrument is situated at more than 700 miles from the earthquake centre, | 当仪器位于距震中700英里以外时，
[03:18.917] the graphic record shows three waves arriving one after the other at short intervals. | 图形记录显示三波地震波以短间隔相继到达。
[03:24.167] The first records the arrival of longitudinal vibrations. | 第一波记录了纵向振动的到达。
[03:27.997] The second marks the arrival of transverse vibrations, | 第二波标志着横向振动的到达，
[03:31.257] which travel more slowly and arrive several minutes after the first. | 它们传播较慢，比第一波晚几分钟到达。
[03:35.257] These two have travelled through the earth. | 这两波都穿过了地球。
[03:37.647] It was from the study of these that so much was learned about the interior of the earth. | 正是通过对它们的深入研究，人们对地球内部有了很多了解。
[03:42.367] The third, or main wave, is the slowest | 第三波，或称主波，是最慢的，
[03:45.027] and has travelled round the earth through the surface rocks. | 并且是沿着地表岩石绕地球传播的。
