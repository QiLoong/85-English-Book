[00:00.671] Passage 49 | 第49段
[00:02.821] Rockets and artificial satellites can go far above the ionosphere and even escape from the earth. | 火箭和人造卫星可以飞到电离层以上很远的地方，甚至可以逃离地球。
[00:09.111] Yet they are complex and expensive. | 然而它们复杂且昂贵。
[00:11.391] And in their present stage of development, they cannot lift massive telescopes, | 而且以它们目前的发展阶段，它们无法举起巨大的望远镜，
[00:15.581] keep them steady while the observations are being carried out, | 在观测进行时保持它们稳定，
[00:19.21] and then return them safely. | 然后安全地返回它们。
[00:21.11] Balloons are much easier to handle and are also vastly cheaper. | 气球更容易操作，而且也便宜得多。
[00:26.91] Their main limitation is that they are incapable of rising to the ionosphere. | 它们的主要限制是无法上升到电离层。
[00:30.931] A height of between 80,000 and 90,000 feet is as much as can reasonably be expected. | 8万到9万英尺的高度已经是合理预期的极限。
[00:37.661] And so balloon-borne instruments can contribute little to either ultraviolet astronomy or X-ray astronomy. | 因此，气球搭载的仪器对紫外线天文学或X射线天文学的贡献很小。
[00:45.191] All the same, the balloon has much to be said in its favor, | 尽管如此，气球仍有许多优点，
[00:48.331] since it can at least carry heavy equipment above most of the atmospheric mass, | 因为它至少可以将重型设备带到大部分大气质量之上，
[00:54.111] thus eliminating blurring and unsteadiness of the images. | 从而消除了图像的模糊和不稳定性。
[00:58.331] Moreover, water vapor and carbon dioxide in the lower air absorb most of the infrared radiation sent to us from the planets. | 此外，低层空气中的水蒸气和二氧化碳吸收了大部分来自行星的红外辐射。
[01:06.181] Balloon ascent overcome this hazard with ease. | 气球上升可以轻松克服这一危险。
[01:10.271] Hot air balloons date back to the year 1783, | 热气球的历史可以追溯到1783年，
[01:13.681] and within a few months of the first flight, a French scientist, Charal, | 第一次飞行后的几个月内，一位法国科学家夏拉尔（Charal），
[01:17.301] went up two miles in a free balloon. | 乘坐自由气球上升了两英里。
[01:20.101] Yet there is little resemblance between these crude vehicles and a modern scientific balloon, | 然而，这些简陋的飞行器与现代科学气球之间几乎没有相似之处，
[01:25.101] which has by now become an important research tool. | 现代科学气球如今已成为重要的研究工具。
[01:29.471] The main development has been carried out by M. Schwarzschild and his team at Princeton University in the United States, | 主要的开发工作是由美国普林斯顿大学的M.施瓦茨希尔德及其团队进行的，
[01:35.601] in collaboration with the United States Navy, the National Science Foundation, | 与美国海军、国家科学基金会，
[01:40.281] and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. | 以及美国国家航空航天局合作。
[01:43.431] The stratosphere flights of 1959, concerned mainly with studies of the sun, were remarkably successful, | 1959年的平流层飞行主要关注太阳研究，取得了显著成功，
[01:50.371] and the project has now been extended. | 该项目现已得到扩展。
[01:53.791] With Stratoscope II, the overall height from the telescope to the top of the launch balloon is 660 feet. | 借助“同温层观测仪II”，从望远镜到发射气球顶部的总高度为660英尺。
[02:01.371] The balloons together weigh over two tons, | 这些气球总重超过两吨，
[02:03.581] and another two tons of ballast are carried for later release if height has to be maintained during the night. | 另外还携带了两吨压载物，以便在夜间需要保持高度时稍后释放。
[02:09.301] The telescope plus its controls weighs three and a half tons. | 望远镜及其控制装置重达三吨半。
[02:13.431] Two large parachutes are also carried in case of emergency. | 此外还携带了两个大型降落伞，以防紧急情况。
[02:17.151] The instruments and their records can be separated from the main balloon system and brought down gently. | 仪器及其记录可以从主气球系统中分离出来，然后轻轻降落。
[02:22.951] Many of the radio and electronic devices used are similar to those of artificial satellites. | 许多使用的无线电和电子设备都与人造卫星的设备相似。
