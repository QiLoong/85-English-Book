[00:00.601] Passage 45. | 第45段。
[00:02.401] At the age of 12 years, the human body is at its most vigorous. | 在12岁的时候，人体是最有活力的。
[00:06.841] It has yet to reach its full size and strength, | 它尚未达到其完整的尺寸和力量，
[00:09.911] and its owner, his or her full intelligence. | 它的主人也尚未达到其完全的智力。
[00:13.521] But at this age, the likelihood of death is least. | 但在这个年龄，死亡的可能性最小。
[00:17.511] Earlier, we were infants and young children, | 之前，我们是婴儿和幼儿，
[00:20.911] and consequently more vulnerable. | 因此也更脆弱。
[00:23.581] Later, we shall undergo a progressive loss of our vigour and resistance, | 之后，我们将经历活力和抵抗力逐渐丧失的过程，
[00:27.971] which, though imperceptible at first, | 起初虽然难以察觉，
[00:30.311] will finally become so steep that we can live no longer, | 但最终会变得如此剧烈，以至于我们无法再活下去，
[00:34.021] however well we look after ourselves, | 无论我们如何精心照顾自己，
[00:36.211] and however well society and our doctors look after us. | 也无论社会和我们的医生如何照顾我们。
[00:40.421] This decline in vigour with the passing of time is called aging. | 这种随着时间推移而衰退的活力被称为衰老。
[00:43.601] It is one of the most unpleasant discoveries which we all make, | 这是我们所有人都会遇到的最不愉快的发现之一，
[00:48.061] and we must decline in this way that if we escape wars, accidents, and diseases, | 我们必然会以这种方式衰退，即使我们避开了战争、事故和疾病，
[00:54.401] we shall eventually die of old age. | 我们最终也会因年老而死。
[00:56.551] And that this happens at a rate which differs little from person to person, | 而且这种情况发生的速率，人与人之间差异不大，
[01:01.371] so that there are heavy odds in favour of our dying between the ages of 65 and 80. | 所以我们很有可能在65到80岁之间死亡。
[01:07.491] Some of us will die sooner, | 我们中有些人会更早去世，
[01:08.831] a few will live longer, | 少数人会活得更久，
[01:10.511] on into a ninth or tenth decade, | 甚至进入第九或第十年。
[01:13.061] But the chances are against it, and there is a virtual limit on how long we can hope to remain alive, | 但机会渺茫，我们能活多久有一个实际的限制，
[01:18.171] however lucky and robust we are. | 无论我们多么幸运和健壮。
[01:20.401] Normal people tend to forget this process, | 普通人往往会忘记这个过程，
[01:22.751] unless and until they are reminded of it. | 除非并直到他们被提醒。
[01:25.751] We are so familiar with the fact that man ages, | 我们对人类会衰老这个事实太熟悉了，
[01:28.161] that people have for years assumed that the process of losing vigour with time, | 以至于多年来人们一直认为，随着时间流逝而失去活力，
[01:32.491] of becoming more likely to die the older we get, | 随着年龄增长死亡可能性增加的过程，
[01:35.341] was something self-evident, like the cooling of a hot kettle | 就像热水壶变凉，
[01:38.831] or the wearing out of a pair of shoes. | 或者一双鞋磨损一样，是某种不言自明的事情。
[01:41.211] They have also assumed that all animals, and probably other organisms such as trees or even the universe itself, | 他们还假设所有动物，以及其他生物如树木，甚至宇宙本身，
[01:47.451] must in the nature of things wear out. | 本质上都必然会磨损。
[01:50.601] Most animals we commonly observe do in fact age as we do, | 我们通常观察到的大多数动物，如果给予足够长的生命机会，确实会像我们一样衰老。
[01:54.831] if given the chance to live long enough. |
[01:57.061] And mechanical systems like a wound watch or the sun | 而像上紧发条的手表或太阳这样的机械系统，
[02:00.591] do in fact run out of energy in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics. | 确实会根据热力学第二定律耗尽能量。
[02:05.741] Whether the whole universe does so is a moot point at present. | 整个宇宙是否如此，目前尚无定论。
[02:09.681] But these are not analogous to what happens when man ages. | 但这些与人类衰老时发生的情况并不相似。
[02:13.411] A run-down watch is still a watch and can be rewound. | 一块停摆的表仍然是表，可以重新上发条。
[02:16.891] An old watch, by contrast, becomes so worn and unreliable | 相比之下，一块旧表会变得如此磨损和不可靠，
[02:21.111] that it eventually is not worth mending. | 以至于最终不值得修理。
[02:23.591] But a watch can could never repair itself. | 但一块表永远无法自我修复。
[02:26.311] It does not consist of living parts, only of metal, | 它不包含生命部分，只有金属，
[02:29.411] which wears away by friction. | 会因摩擦而磨损。
[02:32.121] We could, at one time, repair ourselves, | 我们曾经能够自我修复，
[02:34.231] well enough at least to overcome all but the most instantly fatal illnesses and accidents. | 至少足以克服除最致命的疾病和事故之外的所有情况。
[02:40.401] Between 12 and 80 years, we gradually lose this power. | 在12到80岁之间，我们逐渐失去这种能力。
[02:44.021] An illness which at 12 would knock us over, | 一种在12岁时能让我们卧床不起的疾病，
[02:46.731] at 80 can knock us out, and into our grave. | 在80岁时可能就会要了我们的命，让我们入土为安。
[02:49.771] If we could stay as vigorous as we are at 12, | 如果我们能像12岁时那样充满活力，
[02:52.311] it would take about 700 years for half of us to die, | 大约需要700年才能有一半的人死去，
[02:55.771] and another 700 for the survivors to be reduced by half again. | 再过700年，幸存者又会减少一半。
