[00:02.000] Some old people are oppressed by the fear of death. | 有些老年人被死亡的恐惧所压迫。
[00:06.000] In the young, there is a justification for this feeling. | 在年轻人身上，这种感觉有其正当理由。
[00:10.000] Young men who have reason to fear that they will be killed in battle, may justifiably feel bitter in the thought that they have been cheated of the best things that life has to offer. | 有理由担心会在战场上被杀害的年轻人，有理由感到痛苦，因为他们认为自己被剥夺了生命所能提供的最好的一切。
[00:21.000] But in an old man who has known human joys and sorrows, and has achieved whatever work it was in him to do, the fear of death is somewhat abject and ignoble. | 但对于一个经历过人间悲欢离合、完成了自己力所能及的所有工作的老年人来说，对死亡的恐惧则显得有些卑劣和可耻。
[00:33.000] The best way to overcome it, so at least it seems to me, is to make your interests gradually wider and more impersonal, until bit by bit, the walls of the ego recede, and your life becomes increasingly merged in the universal life. | 克服它的最佳方法，至少在我看来是这样，是逐渐拓宽你的兴趣，使其更加超然，直到一点一点地，自我的围墙后退，你的生命越来越融入到普遍的生命之中。
[00:52.000] An individual human existence should be like a river. | 个体的生命应该像一条河流。
[00:57.000] Small at first, narrowly contained within its banks, and rushing passionately past boulders and over waterfalls. | 最初很小，被狭窄的河岸限制，然后充满激情地冲过巨石，越过瀑布。
[01:06.000] Gradually, the river grows wider. | 渐渐地，河流变得越来越宽阔。
[01:09.000] The banks recede. | 河岸向后退去。
[01:11.000] The waters flow more quietly. | 河水流淌得更加平静。
[01:14.000] And in the end, without any visible break, they become merged in the sea, and painlessly lose their individual being. | 最终，在没有任何明显的断裂的情况下，它们汇入大海，毫无痛苦地失去了它们的个体存在。
[01:23.000] The man who, in old age, can see his life in this way, will not suffer from the fear of death. | 一个人，在老年时能这样看待自己的生命，就不会被死亡的恐惧所困扰。
[01:30.000] Since the things he cares for will continue. | 因为他所关心的事物将继续存在。
[01:34.000] And if, with the decay of vitality, weariness increases, the thought of rest will be not unwelcome. | 而且，如果随着生命力的衰退，疲惫感增加，那么休息的念头将不会不受欢迎。
[01:42.000] I should wish to die while still at work, knowing that others will carry on what I can no longer do, and content in the thought that what was possible has been done. | 我希望能在我仍在工作时死去，知道其他人会继续我无法再做的事情，并满足于这样的想法：凡是可能的都已完成。
