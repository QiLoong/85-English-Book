[00:12.180]and signed by the then reigning monarch of France, Louis Philippe. | 由当时法国的执政君主路易·菲利普签署。
[00:16.630]He'd been on the throne for barely eight months when he authorized this measure, | 他登基才不到八个月就批准了这项措施，
[00:20.730]which was as much a product of necessity as of careful planning, | 这与其说是精心策划的结果，不如说是形势所迫，

[00:27.760]The reasons for forming the French Foreign Legion were probably twofold. | 组建法国外籍军团的原因可能有两个方面。
[00:32.480]In the first place, the men of the disbanded Royal bodyguard and the regiment of Hohenlohe, | 首先，被解散的皇家卫队和霍恩洛厄团的士兵，

[00:48.420]They were trained to the use of arms and should they become tools of the politically ambitious or discontented, | 他们受过武器使用训练，如果他们成为政治野心家或不满者的工具，
[00:54.600]they would present a distinct menace to the new regime, | 他们将对新政权构成明显的威胁，
[00:57.650]not yet too firmly established and unsure of itself. | 这个政权尚未稳固，对自己也不太自信。
[01:02.130]For some time, Paris had been swarming with countless other discharged foreign soldiers | 一段时间以来，巴黎挤满了无数其他退役的外国士兵，
[01:07.130]who had served in the French army at various times under the empire and the Republic, | 他们曾在帝国和共和国时期在法国军队中服役，
[01:12.190]many of whom were in needy circumstances and open to suggestion, | 其中许多人处境艰难，容易受人蛊惑，

[01:21.570]It was clearly both expedient and desirable to remove these dangers as far away from the capital as possible. | 显然，将这些危险尽可能地从首都移走是既权宜又可取的。
[01:28.160]Next, the Algerian adventure had begun, and it appeared that this might prove expensive in lives. | 其次，阿尔及利亚冒险行动已经开始，这似乎可能造成人员伤亡。
[01:34.200]The more Frenchmen killed in North Africa, the less popular the government at home would be. | 在北非被杀的法国人越多，国内政府的受欢迎程度就越低。

[01:57.750]Most were wary and many apprehensive as to how the Algerian business would turn out. | 大多数人对此持谨慎态度，许多人担心阿尔及利亚事务会如何发展。
[02:03.620]The formation of a foreign legion seemed therefore to be an ideal method of killing these two birds with one stone. | 因此，组建一支外籍军团似乎是两全其美的理想方法。
[02:09.910]Once the conditions were made clear, there does not seem to have been any serious opposition. | 一旦条件明确，似乎就没有出现任何严重的反对意见。
[02:15.390]Marshal Soult was reputed to be the man behind the scheme, | 索尔特元帅被认为是这项计划的幕后主使，
[02:18.450]both for removing and using the unemployed foreign ex-soldiers. | 既为了清除，也为了利用那些失业的外国退役士兵。

[02:28.320]how useful they would be both for garrison duty and for active operations in Algeria. | 无论是在驻防任务还是在阿尔及利亚的积极行动中，他们都将多么有用。
[02:34.110]Nor the fact that if their casualties were heavy or their conditions not of the best, | 也不会出现这样的情况：如果他们伤亡惨重或条件不佳，
[02:38.740]there would be no embarrassing reaction for agitation in France on their behalf. | 法国国内就不会因为为他们而引起的煽动而出现尴尬的反应。

[03:06.630]but as it was the only scrap of foreign territory of any size possessed by France at that moment, | 但由于它是当时法国拥有的唯一一块有一定规模的外国领土，
[03:12.020]there was no doubt as to the meaning of the phrase outside France. | 因此“法国境外”这个短语的含义毫无疑问。
