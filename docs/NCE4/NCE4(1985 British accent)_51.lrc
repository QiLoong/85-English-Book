[00:00.000] Unit 6, Passage 51. | 第6单元, 第51篇课文。
[00:04.030] Two main techniques have been used for training elephants, which we may call respectively the tough and the gentle. | 训练大象主要有两种方法，我们可分别称之为“强硬法”和“温柔法”。
[00:11.510] The former method simply consists of setting an elephant to work and beating him until he does what is expected of him. | 前者只是让大象工作，并鞭打它，直到它按要求行事。
[00:18.420] Apart from any moral considerations, this is a stupid method of training, | 抛开道德因素不谈，这是一种愚蠢的训练方法，
[00:22.560] for it produces a resentful animal who at a later stage may well turn mankiller. | 因为它会培养出心怀怨恨的大象，日后很可能会变成杀人象。
[00:28.100] The gentle method requires more patience in the early stages, | 温柔法在初期需要更多的耐心，
[00:32.220] but produces a cheerful, good-tempered elephant who will give many years of loyal service. | 但会培养出性情开朗、温顺的大象，它们会提供多年忠诚的服务。
[00:39.460] The first essential in elephant training is to assign to the animal a single mahout, | 训练大象的首要任务是给它指派一个专属象夫，
[00:43.760] who will be entirely responsible for the job. | 象夫将全权负责这项工作。
[00:47.380] Elephants like to have one master just as dogs do, | 大象喜欢有一个主人，就像狗一样，
[00:50.690] and are capable of a considerable degree of personal affection. | 而且它们能够表现出相当程度的个人情感。
[00:55.070] There are even stories of half-trained elephant calves who have refused to feed and pined to death when by some unavoidable circumstance they have been deprived of their own trainer. | 甚至有这样的故事：半驯化的小象，因不可避免的情况被剥夺了专属驯象师后，拒绝进食并最终饿死。
[01:05.740] Such extreme cases must probably be taken with a grain of salt, | 这种极端的例子可能需要有所保留，
[01:10.090] but they do underline the general principle that the relationship between elephant and mahout is the key to successful training. | 但它们确实强调了一个普遍原则：大象与象夫之间的关系是成功训练的关键。
[01:17.650] The most economical age to capture an elephant for training is between 15 and 20 years, | 捕捉大象进行训练最经济的年龄是15到20岁之间，
[01:22.950] for it is then almost ready to undertake heavy work and can begin to earn its keep straight away. | 因为那时它几乎可以立即开始繁重的工作，并开始自食其力。
[01:29.350] But animals of this age do not easily become subservient to man, | 但这个年龄段的动物不容易顺从人类，
[01:33.240] and a very firm hand must be employed in the early stages. | 因此在早期阶段必须采取非常坚定的手段。
[01:37.420] The captive elephant, still roped to a tree, plunges and screams every time a man approaches, | 被捕获的大象，仍然被绳子拴在树上，每当有人靠近时，它就会猛冲并尖叫，
[01:42.500] and for several days will probably refuse all food through anger and fear. | 并且在几天内，可能会因为愤怒和恐惧而拒绝所有食物。
[01:46.730] Sometimes a tame elephant is tethered nearby to give the wild one confidence. | 有时，会将一头驯服的大象拴在附近，以给予野生大象信心。
[01:51.270] In most cases the captive gradually quietens down and begins to accept its food. | 在大多数情况下，被捕获的大象会逐渐平静下来，并开始接受食物。
[01:57.170] The next stage is to get the elephant to the training establishment, | 下一个阶段是将大象带到训练场所，
[02:00.170] a ticklish business which is achieved with the aid of two tame elephants roped to the captive on either side. | 这是一项棘手的工作，需要借助两头驯服的大象，它们被分别拴在被捕获大象的两侧。
[02:07.030] When several elephants are being trained at one time, | 当同时训练几头大象时，
[02:09.520] it's customary for the new arrival to be placed between the stalls of two captives whose training is already well advanced. | 通常会将新来的大象放在两头训练有素的被捕获大象的兽栏之间。
[02:16.190] It's then left completely undisturbed with plenty of food and water, | 之后它会被完全不被打扰地留下，并有充足的食物和水，
[02:20.670] so that it can absorb the atmosphere of its new home and see that nothing particularly alarming is happening to its companions. | 这样它就能融入新家的氛围，并看到它的同伴没有发生什么特别令人警惕的事情。
[02:27.760] When it's eating normally, its own training begins. | 当它正常进食时，它自己的训练就开始了。
[02:30.680] The trainer stands in front of the elephant holding a long stick with a sharp metal point. | 驯象师站在大象面前，手持一根带有锋利金属尖头的长棍。
[02:35.530] Two assistants mounted on tame elephants control the captive from either side, | 两名骑着驯服大象的助手从两侧控制被捕获的大象，
[02:39.560] while others rub their hands over his skin to the accompaniment of monotonous and soothing chant. | 而其他人则抚摸它的皮肤，同时伴随着单调而舒缓的歌唱。
[02:45.390] This is supposed to induce pleasurable sensations in the elephant, | 这被认为能在大象身上引发愉悦的感觉，
[02:49.490] and its effects are reinforced by the use of endearing epithets such as "Ho, my son" or "Ho, my father" or "my mother" | 它的效果通过使用“嗨，我的儿子”或“嗨，我的父亲”或“我的母亲”等亲昵称呼而得到加强，
[02:57.170] according to the age and sex of the captive. | 具体根据被捕获大象的年龄和性别而定。
[02:59.650] The elephant is not immediately susceptible to such blandishments, however, | 然而，大象并不会立即受这些甜言蜜语的影响，
[03:03.200] and usually lashes fiercely with its trunk in all directions. | 通常会用鼻子猛烈地向四面八方甩动。
[03:07.480] These movements are controlled by the trainer with the metal-pointed stick. | 这些动作由驯象师用带有金属尖头的棍子控制。
[03:12.300] And the trunk eventually becomes so sore that the elephant curls it up and seldom afterwards uses it for offensive purposes. | 鼻子最终会变得非常疼痛，以至于大象会把它卷起来，之后也很少用它来进行攻击。
